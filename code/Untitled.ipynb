       "\"           the emperor's new clothes       the swineherd       the real princess       the shoes of fortune       the fir tree       the snow queen       the leap-frog       the elderbush       the bell       the old house       the happy family       the story of a mother       the false collar       the shadow       the little match girl       the dream of little tuk       the naughty boy       the red shoes          the emperor's new clothes    many years ago  there was an emperor  who was so excessively fond of  new clothes  that he spent all his money in dress. he did not trouble  himself in the least about his soldiers  nor did he care to go either to  the theatre or the chase  except for the opportunities then afforded him  for displaying his new clothes. he had a different suit for each hour of  the day  and as of any other king or emperor  one is accustomed to say   “he is sitting in council ” it was always said of him  “the emperor is  sitting in his wardrobe.”    time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital  strangers  arrived every day at the court. one day  two rogues  calling themselves  weavers  made their appearance. they gave out that they knew how to  weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns  the  clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of  remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held  or  who was extraordinarily simple in character.    “these must  indeed  be splendid clothes!” thought the emperor. “had i  such a suit  i might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit  for their office  and also be able to distinguish the wise from the  foolish! this stuff must be woven for me immediately.” and he caused  large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they  might begin their work directly.    so the two pretended weavers set up two looms  and affected to work very  busily  though in reality they did nothing at all. they asked for the  most delicate silk and the purest gold thread  put both into their own  knapsacks  and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms  until late at night.    “i should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth ”   said the emperor to himself  after some little time had elapsed  he was   however  rather embarrassed  when he remembered that a simpleton  or  one unfit for his office  would be unable to see the manufacture. to be  sure  he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person  but yet  he  would prefer sending somebody else  to bring him intelligence about the  weavers  and their work  before he troubled himself in the affair. all  the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the  cloth was to possess  and all were anxious to learn how wise  or how  ignorant  their neighbors might prove to be.    “i will send my faithful old minister to the weavers ” said the emperor  at last  after some deliberation  “he will be best able to see how the  cloth looks  for he is a man of sense  and no one can be more suitable  for his office than he is.”    so the faithful old minister went into the hall  where the knaves were  working with all their might  at their empty looms. “what can be the  meaning of this?” thought the old man  opening his eyes very wide. “i  cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.” however  he did  not express his thoughts aloud.    the impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come  nearer their looms  and then asked him whether the design pleased  him  and whether the colors were not very beautiful  at the same time  pointing to the empty frames. the poor old minister looked and looked   he could not discover anything on the looms  for a very good reason   viz: there was nothing there. “what!” thought he again. “is it possible  that i am a simpleton? i have never thought so myself  and no one must  know it now if i am so. can it be  that i am unfit for my office? no   that must not be said either. i will never confess that i could not see  the stuff.”    “well  sir minister!” said one of the knaves  still pretending to work.  “you do not say whether the stuff pleases you.”    “oh  it is excellent!” replied the old minister  looking at the loom  through his spectacles. “this pattern  and the colors  yes  i will tell  the emperor without delay  how very beautiful i think them.”    “we shall be much obliged to you ” said the impostors  and then they  named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended  stuff. the old minister listened attentively to their words  in order  that he might repeat them to the emperor  and then the knaves asked for  more silk and gold  saying that it was necessary to complete what  they had begun. however  they put all that was given them into their  knapsacks  and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as  before at their empty looms.    the emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men  were getting on  and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be  ready. it was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister   he surveyed the looms on all sides  but could see nothing at all but the  empty frames.    “does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you  as it did to my lord the  minister?” asked the impostors of the emperor's second ambassador  at  the same time making the same gestures as before  and talking of the  design and colors which were not there.    “i certainly am not stupid!” thought the messenger. “it must be  that i  am not fit for my good  profitable office! that is very odd  however  no  one shall know anything about it.” and accordingly he praised the stuff  he could not see  and declared that he was delighted with both colors  and patterns. “indeed  please your imperial majesty ” said he to his  sovereign when he returned  “the cloth which the weavers are preparing  is extraordinarily magnificent.”    the whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the emperor had  ordered to be woven at his own expense.    and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture  while  it was still in the loom. accompanied by a select number of officers of  the court  among whom were the two honest men who had already admired  the cloth  he went to the crafty impostors  who  as soon as they were  aware of the emperor's approach  went on working more diligently than  ever  although they still did not pass a single thread through the  looms.    “is not the work absolutely magnificent?” said the two officers of the  crown  already mentioned. “if your majesty will only be pleased to look  at it! what a splendid design! what glorious colors!” and at the same  time they pointed to the empty frames  for they imagined that everyone  else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.    “how is this?” said the emperor to himself. “i can see nothing! this  is indeed a terrible affair! am i a simpleton  or am i unfit to be an  emperor? that would be the worst thing that could happen--oh! the cloth  is charming ” said he  aloud. “it has my complete approbation.” and he  smiled most graciously  and looked closely at the empty looms  for on no  account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of  his court had praised so much. all his retinue now strained their eyes   hoping to discover something on the looms  but they could see no more  than the others  nevertheless  they all exclaimed  “oh  how beautiful!”   and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid  material  for the approaching procession. “magnificent! charming!  excellent!” resounded on all sides  and everyone was uncommonly gay. the  emperor shared in the general satisfaction  and presented the impostors  with the riband of an order of knighthood  to be worn in their  button-holes  and the title of “gentlemen weavers.”    the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the  procession was to take place  and had sixteen lights burning  so that  everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the emperor's new  suit. they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms  cut the air with  their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them.  “see!” cried they  at last. “the emperor's new clothes are ready!”    and now the emperor  with all the grandees of his court  came to the  weavers  and the rogues raised their arms  as if in the act of holding  something up  saying  “here are your majesty's trousers! here is the  scarf! here is the mantle! the whole suit is as light as a cobweb   one might fancy one has nothing at all on  when dressed in it  that   however  is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.”    “yes indeed!” said all the courtiers  although not one of them could see  anything of this exquisite manufacture.    “if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your  clothes  we will fit on the new suit  in front of the looking glass.”    the emperor was accordingly undressed  and the rogues pretended to  array him in his new suit  the emperor turning round  from side to side   before the looking glass.    “how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes  and how well they  fit!” everyone cried out. “what a design! what colors! these are indeed  royal robes!”    “the canopy which is to be borne over your majesty  in the procession   is waiting ” announced the chief master of the ceremonies.    “i am quite ready ” answered the emperor. “do my new clothes fit well?”   asked he  turning himself round again before the looking glass  in order  that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.    the lords of the bedchamber  who were to carry his majesty's train felt  about on the ground  as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle   and pretended to be carrying something  for they would by no means  betray anything like simplicity  or unfitness for their office.    so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the  procession  through the streets of his capital  and all the people  standing by  and those at the windows  cried out  “oh! how beautiful  are our emperor's new clothes! what a magnificent train there is to  the mantle  and how gracefully the scarf hangs!” in short  no one would  allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes  because  in  doing so  he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit  for his office. certainly  none of the emperor's various suits  had ever  made so great an impression  as these invisible ones.    “but the emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.    “listen to the voice of innocence!” exclaimed his father  and what the  child had said was whispered from one to another.    “but he has nothing at all on!” at last cried out all the people.  the emperor was vexed  for he knew that the people were right  but he  thought the procession must go on now! and the lords of the bedchamber  took greater pains than ever  to appear holding up a train  although  in  reality  there was no train to hold.          the swineherd    there was once a poor prince  who had a kingdom. his kingdom was very  small  but still quite large enough to marry upon  and he wished to  marry.    it was certainly rather cool of him to say to the emperor's daughter   “will you have me?” but so he did  for his name was renowned far and  wide  and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered   “yes!” and “thank you kindly.” we shall see what this princess said.    listen!    it happened that where the prince's father lay buried  there grew a rose  tree--a most beautiful rose tree  which blossomed only once in every  five years  and even then bore only one flower  but that was a rose!  it smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who  inhaled its fragrance.    and furthermore  the prince had a nightingale  who could sing in such a  manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little  throat. so the princess was to have the rose  and the nightingale  and  they were accordingly put into large silver caskets  and sent to her.    the emperor had them brought into a large hall  where the princess was  playing at “visiting ” with the ladies of the court  and when she saw  the caskets with the presents  she clapped her hands for joy.    “ah  if it were but a little pussy-cat!” said she  but the rose tree   with its beautiful rose came to view.    “oh  how prettily it is made!” said all the court ladies.    “it is more than pretty ” said the emperor  “it is charming!”    but the princess touched it  and was almost ready to cry.    “fie  papa!” said she. “it is not made at all  it is natural!”    “let us see what is in the other casket  before we get into a bad  humor ” said the emperor. so the nightingale came forth and sang so  delightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.    “superbe! charmant!” exclaimed the ladies  for they all used to chatter  french  each one worse than her neighbor.    “how much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our  blessed empress ” said an old knight. “oh yes! these are the same tones   the same execution.”    “yes! yes!” said the emperor  and he wept like a child at the  remembrance.    “i will still hope that it is not a real bird ” said the princess.    “yes  it is a real bird ” said those who had brought it. “well then let  the bird fly ” said the princess  and she positively refused to see the  prince.    however  he was not to be discouraged  he daubed his face over brown and  black  pulled his cap over his ears  and knocked at the door.    “good day to my lord  the emperor!” said he. “can i have employment at  the palace?”    “why  yes ” said the emperor. “i want some one to take care of the pigs   for we have a great many of them.”    so the prince was appointed “imperial swineherd.” he had a dirty little  room close by the pigsty  and there he sat the whole day  and worked. by  the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. little bells were  hung all round it  and when the pot was boiling  these bells tinkled in  the most charming manner  and played the old melody         “ach! du lieber augustin       alles ist weg  weg  weg!”*        * “ah! dear augustine!      all is gone  gone  gone!”      but what was still more curious  whoever held his finger in the smoke of  the kitchen-pot  immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on  every hearth in the city--this  you see  was something quite different  from the rose.    now the princess happened to walk that way  and when she heard the tune   she stood quite still  and seemed pleased  for she could play “lieber  augustine”  it was the only piece she knew  and she played it with one  finger.    “why there is my piece ” said the princess. “that swineherd must  certainly have been well educated! go in and ask him the price of the  instrument.”    so one of the court-ladies must run in  however  she drew on wooden  slippers first.    “what will you take for the kitchen-pot?” said the lady.    “i will have ten kisses from the princess ” said the swineherd.    “yes  indeed!” said the lady.    “i cannot sell it for less ” rejoined the swineherd.    “he is an impudent fellow!” said the princess  and she walked on  but  when she had gone a little way  the bells tinkled so prettily        “ach! du lieber augustin       alles ist weg  weg  weg!”    “stay ” said the princess. “ask him if he will have ten kisses from the  ladies of my court.”    “no  thank you!” said the swineherd. “ten kisses from the princess  or i  keep the kitchen-pot myself.”    “that must not be  either!” said the princess. “but do you all stand  before me that no one may see us.”    and the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her  and spread  out their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses  and the princess--the  kitchen-pot.    that was delightful! the pot was boiling the whole evening  and the  whole of the following day. they knew perfectly well what was cooking at  every fire throughout the city  from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's   the court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.    “we know who has soup  and who has pancakes for dinner to-day  who has  cutlets  and who has eggs. how interesting!”    “yes  but keep my secret  for i am an emperor's daughter.”    the swineherd--that is to say--the prince  for no one knew that he was  other than an ill-favored swineherd  let not a day pass without working  at something  he at last constructed a rattle  which  when it was swung  round  played all the waltzes and jig tunes  which have ever been heard  since the creation of the world.    “ah  that is superbe!” said the princess when she passed by. “i have  never heard prettier compositions! go in and ask him the price of the  instrument  but mind  he shall have no more kisses!”    “he will have a hundred kisses from the princess!” said the lady who had  been to ask.    “i think he is not in his right senses!” said the princess  and walked  on  but when she had gone a little way  she stopped again. “one must  encourage art ” said she  “i am the emperor's daughter. tell him he  shall  as on yesterday  have ten kisses from me  and may take the rest  from the ladies of the court.”    “oh--but we should not like that at all!” said they. “what are you  muttering?” asked the princess. “if i can kiss him  surely you can.  remember that you owe everything to me.” so the ladies were obliged to  go to him again.    “a hundred kisses from the princess ” said he  “or else let everyone  keep his own!”    “stand round!” said she  and all the ladies stood round her whilst the  kissing was going on.    “what can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?” said the  emperor  who happened just then to step out on the balcony  he rubbed  his eyes  and put on his spectacles. “they are the ladies of the  court  i must go down and see what they are about!” so he pulled up his  slippers at the heel  for he had trodden them down.    as soon as he had got into the court-yard  he moved very softly  and the  ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses  that all might  go on fairly  that they did not perceive the emperor. he rose on his  tiptoes.    “what is all this?” said he  when he saw what was going on  and he boxed  the princess's ears with his slipper  just as the swineherd was taking  the eighty-sixth kiss.    “march out!” said the emperor  for he was very angry  and both princess  and swineherd were thrust out of the city.    the princess now stood and wept  the swineherd scolded  and the rain  poured down.    “alas! unhappy creature that i am!” said the princess. “if i had but  married the handsome young prince! ah! how unfortunate i am!”    and the swineherd went behind a tree  washed the black and brown color  from his face  threw off his dirty clothes  and stepped forth in his  princely robes  he looked so noble that the princess could not help  bowing before him.    “i am come to despise thee ” said he. “thou would'st not have an  honorable prince! thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale   but thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery  plaything. thou art rightly served.”    he then went back to his own little kingdom  and shut the door of his  palace in her face. now she might well sing         “ach! du lieber augustin       alles ist weg  weg  weg!”          the real princess    there was once a prince who wished to marry a princess  but then she  must be a real princess. he travelled all over the world in hopes of  finding such a lady  but there was always something wrong. princesses he  found in plenty  but whether they were real princesses it was impossible  for him to decide  for now one thing  now another  seemed to him not  quite right about the ladies. at last he returned to his palace quite  cast down  because he wished so much to have a real princess for his  wife.    one evening a fearful tempest arose  it thundered and lightened  and the  rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides  it was as dark as  pitch. all at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door  and  the old king  the prince's father  went out himself to open it.    it was a princess who was standing outside the door. what with the rain  and the wind  she was in a sad condition  the water trickled down from  her hair  and her clothes clung to her body. she said she was a real  princess.    “ah! we shall soon see that!” thought the old queen-mother  however  she  said not a word of what she was going to do  but went quietly into the  bedroom  took all the bed-clothes off the bed  and put three little peas  on the bedstead. she then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over  the three peas  and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.    upon this bed the princess was to pass the night.    the next morning she was asked how she had slept. “oh  very badly  indeed!” she replied. “i have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night  through. i do not know what was in my bed  but i had something hard  under me  and am all over black and blue. it has hurt me so much!”    now it was plain that the lady must be a real princess  since she had  been able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses  and twenty feather beds. none but a real princess could have had such a  delicate sense of feeling.    the prince accordingly made her his wife  being now convinced that he  had found a real princess. the three peas were however put into the  cabinet of curiosities  where they are still to be seen  provided they  are not lost.    wasn't this a lady of real delicacy?          the shoes of fortune    i. a beginning    every author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style  of writing. those who do not like him  magnify it  shrug up their  shoulders  and exclaim--there he is again! i  for my part  know very  well how i can bring about this movement and this exclamation. it would  happen immediately if i were to begin here  as i intended to do  with:  “rome has its corso  naples its toledo”--“ah! that andersen  there he is  again!” they would cry  yet i must  to please my fancy  continue quite  quietly  and add: “but copenhagen has its east street.”    here  then  we will stay for the present. in one of the houses not far  from the new market a party was invited--a very large party  in order   as is often the case  to get a return invitation from the others. one  half of the company was already seated at the card-table  the other half  awaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady  of the house:    “now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.”    they had got just so far  and the conversation began to crystallise   as it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world  supplied. amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some  praised that period as far more interesting  far more poetical than our  own too sober present  indeed councillor knap defended this opinion  so warmly  that the hostess declared immediately on his side  and both  exerted themselves with unwearied eloquence. the councillor boldly  declared the time of king hans to be the noblest and the most happy  period.*    * a.d. 1482-1513      while the conversation turned on this subject  and was only for a moment  interrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth  reading  we will just step out into the antechamber  where cloaks   mackintoshes  sticks  umbrellas  and shoes  were deposited. here sat two  female figures  a young and an old one. one might have thought at first  they were servants come to accompany their mistresses home  but on  looking nearer  one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants  their  forms were too noble for that  their skin too fine  the cut of their  dress too striking. two fairies were they  the younger  it is true   was not dame fortune herself  but one of the waiting-maids of her  handmaidens who carry about the lesser good things that she distributes   the other looked extremely gloomy--it was care. she always attends to  her own serious business herself  as then she is sure of having it done  properly.    they were telling each other  with a confidential interchange of ideas   where they had been during the day. the messenger of fortune had only  executed a few unimportant commissions  such as saving a new bonnet from  a shower of rain  etc.  but what she had yet to perform was something  quite unusual.    “i must tell you ” said she  “that to-day is my birthday  and in honor  of it  a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me   which i am to carry to mankind. these shoes possess the property of  instantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period  in which he most wishes to be  every wish  as regards time or place  or  state of being  will be immediately fulfilled  and so at last man will  be happy  here below.”    “do you seriously believe it?” replied care  in a severe tone of  reproach. “no  he will be very unhappy  and will assuredly bless the  moment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes.”    “stupid nonsense!” said the other angrily. “i will put them here by  the door. some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong  ones--he will be a happy man.”    such was their conversation.      ii. what happened to the councillor    it was late  councillor knap  deeply occupied with the times of king  hans  intended to go home  and malicious fate managed matters so that  his feet  instead of finding their way to his own galoshes  slipped  into those of fortune. thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the  well-lighted rooms into east street. by the magic power of the shoes he  was carried back to the times of king hans  on which account his foot  very naturally sank in the mud and puddles of the street  there having  been in those days no pavement in copenhagen.    “well! this is too bad! how dirty it is here!” sighed the councillor.  “as to a pavement  i can find no traces of one  and all the lamps  it  seems  have gone to sleep.”    the moon was not yet very high  it was besides rather foggy  so that  in the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion. at the  next corner hung a votive lamp before a madonna  but the light it gave  was little better than none at all  indeed  he did not observe it before  he was exactly under it  and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the  pictures which represented the well-known group of the virgin and the  infant jesus.    “that is probably a wax-work show ” thought he  “and the people delay  taking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two.”    a few persons in the costume of the time of king hans passed quickly by  him.    “how strange they look! the good folks come probably from a masquerade!”    suddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes  the bright blaze of a  fire shot up from time to time  and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend  with the bluish light of the torches. the councillor stood still  and  watched a most strange procession pass by. first came a dozen drummers   who understood pretty well how to handle their instruments  then came  halberdiers  and some armed with cross-bows. the principal person in the  procession was a priest. astonished at what he saw  the councillor asked  what was the meaning of all this mummery  and who that man was.    “that's the bishop of zealand ” was the answer.    “good heavens! what has taken possession of the bishop?” sighed the  councillor  shaking his head. it certainly could not be the bishop  even  though he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom  and  people told the drollest anecdotes about him. reflecting on the matter   and without looking right or left  the councillor went through east  street and across the habro-platz. the bridge leading to palace square  was not to be found  scarcely trusting his senses  the nocturnal  wanderer discovered a shallow piece of water  and here fell in with two  men who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat.    “does your honor want to cross the ferry to the holme?” asked they.    “across to the holme!” said the councillor  who knew nothing of the age  in which he at that moment was. “no  i am going to christianshafen  to  little market street.”    both men stared at him in astonishment.    “only just tell me where the bridge is ” said he. “it is really  unpardonable that there are no lamps here  and it is as dirty as if one  had to wade through a morass.”    the longer he spoke with the boatmen  the more unintelligible did their  language become to him.    “i don't understand your bornholmish dialect ” said he at last  angrily   and turning his back upon them. he was unable to find the bridge: there  was no railway either. “it is really disgraceful what a state this place  is in ” muttered he to himself. never had his age  with which  however   he was always grumbling  seemed so miserable as on this evening. “i'll  take a hackney-coach!” thought he. but where were the hackney-coaches?  not one was to be seen.    “i must go back to the new market  there  it is to be hoped  i  shall find some coaches  for if i don't  i shall never get safe to  christianshafen.”    so off he went in the direction of east street  and had nearly got to  the end of it when the moon shone forth.    “god bless me! what wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up  there?” cried he involuntarily  as he looked at east gate  which  in  those days  was at the end of east street.    he found  however  a little side-door open  and through this he went   and stepped into our new market of the present time. it was a huge  desolate plain  some wild bushes stood up here and there  while across  the field flowed a broad canal or river. some wretched hovels for the  dutch sailors  resembling great boxes  and after which the place was  named  lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank.    “i either behold a fata morgana  or i am regularly tipsy ” whimpered out  the councillor. “but what's this?”    he turned round anew  firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. he  gazed at the street formerly so well known to him  and now so strange in  appearance  and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were  of wood  slightly put together  and many had a thatched roof.    “no--i am far from well ” sighed he  “and yet i drank only one glass of  punch  but i cannot suppose it--it was  too  really very wrong to give  us punch and hot salmon for supper. i shall speak about it at the first  opportunity. i have half a mind to go back again  and say what i suffer.  but no  that would be too silly  and heaven only knows if they are up  still.”    he looked for the house  but it had vanished.    “it is really dreadful ” groaned he with increasing anxiety  “i cannot  recognise east street again  there is not a single decent shop from one  end to the other! nothing but wretched huts can i see anywhere  just  as if i were at ringstead. oh! i am ill! i can scarcely bear myself any  longer. where the deuce can the house be? it must be here on this very  spot  yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance  to such a  degree has everything changed this night! at all events here are some  people up and stirring. oh! oh! i am certainly very ill.”    he now hit upon a half-open door  through a chink of which a faint light  shone. it was a sort of hostelry of those times  a kind of public-house.  the room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in holstein  a  pretty numerous company  consisting of seamen  copenhagen burghers  and  a few scholars  sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans  and  gave little heed to the person who entered.    “by your leave!” said the councillor to the hostess  who came bustling  towards him. “i've felt so queer all of a sudden  would you have the  goodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to christianshafen?”    the woman examined him with eyes of astonishment  and shook her head   she then addressed him in german. the councillor thought she did not  understand danish  and therefore repeated his wish in german. this  in  connection with his costume  strengthened the good woman in the belief  that he was a foreigner. that he was ill  she comprehended directly  so  she brought him a pitcher of water  which tasted certainly pretty strong  of the sea  although it had been fetched from the well.    the councillor supported his head on his hand  drew a long breath  and  thought over all the wondrous things he saw around him.    “is this the daily news of this evening?” he asked mechanically  as he  saw the hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.    the meaning of this councillorship query remained  of course  a riddle  to her  yet she handed him the paper without replying. it was a coarse  wood-cut  representing a splendid meteor “as seen in the town of  cologne ” which was to be read below in bright letters.    “that is very old!” said the councillor  whom this piece of antiquity  began to make considerably more cheerful. “pray how did you come into  possession of this rare print? it is extremely interesting  although the  whole is a mere fable. such meteorous appearances are to be explained in  this way--that they are the reflections of the aurora borealis  and it  is highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.”    those persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech   stared at him in wonderment  and one of them rose  took off his hat  respectfully  and said with a serious countenance  “you are no doubt a  very learned man  monsieur.”    “oh no ” answered the councillor  “i can only join in conversation on  this topic and on that  as indeed one must do according to the demands  of the world at present.”    “modestia is a fine virtue ” continued the gentleman  “however  as to  your speech  i must say mihi secus videtur: yet i am willing to suspend  my judicium.”    “may i ask with whom i have the pleasure of speaking?” asked the  councillor.    “i am a bachelor in theologia ” answered the gentleman with a stiff  reverence.    this reply fully satisfied the councillor  the title suited the dress.  “he is certainly ” thought he  “some village schoolmaster--some queer  old fellow  such as one still often meets with in jutland.”    “this is no locus docendi  it is true ” began the clerical gentleman   “yet i beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. your reading  in the ancients is  sine dubio  of vast extent?”    “oh yes  i've read something  to be sure ” replied the councillor. “i  like reading all useful works  but i do not on that account despise the  modern ones  'tis only the unfortunate 'tales of every-day life' that i  cannot bear--we have enough and more than enough such in reality.”    “'tales of every-day life?'” said our bachelor inquiringly.    “i mean those new fangled novels  twisting and writhing themselves in  the dust of commonplace  which also expect to find a reading public.”    “oh ” exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling  “there is much wit in  them  besides they are read at court. the king likes the history of sir  iffven and sir gaudian particularly  which treats of king arthur  and  his knights of the round table  he has more than once joked about it  with his high vassals.”    “i have not read that novel ” said the councillor  “it must be quite a  new one  that heiberg has published lately.”    “no ” answered the theologian of the time of king hans: “that book is  not written by a heiberg  but was imprinted by godfrey von gehmen.”    “oh  is that the author's name?” said the councillor. “it is a very  old name  and  as well as i recollect  he was the first printer that  appeared in denmark.”    “yes  he is our first printer ” replied the clerical gentleman hastily.    so far all went on well. some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of  the dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back   meaning that of 1484. the councillor imagined it was the cholera that  was meant  which people made so much fuss about  and the discourse  passed off satisfactorily enough. the war of the buccaneers of 1490 was  so recent that it could not fail being alluded to  the english  pirates had  they said  most shamefully taken their ships while in the  roadstead  and the councillor  before whose eyes the herostratic [*]  event of 1801 still floated vividly  agreed entirely with the others in  abusing the rascally english. with other topics he was not so fortunate   every moment brought about some new confusion  and threatened to become  a perfect babel  for the worthy bachelor was really too ignorant  and  the simplest observations of the councillor sounded to him too daring  and phantastical. they looked at one another from the crown of the head  to the soles of the feet  and when matters grew to too high a  pitch  then the bachelor talked latin  in the hope of being better  understood--but it was of no use after all.         * herostratus  or eratostratus--an ephesian  who wantonly       set fire to the famous temple of diana  in order to       commemorate his name by so uncommon an action.    “what's the matter?” asked the hostess  plucking the councillor by the  sleeve  and now his recollection returned  for in the course of the  conversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it.    “merciful god  where am i!” exclaimed he in agony  and while he so  thought  all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness  against  which he struggled with the utmost power of desperation  encompassed  him with renewed force. “let us drink claret and mead  and bremen beer ”   shouted one of the guests--“and you shall drink with us!”    two maidens approached. one wore a cap of two staring colors  denoting  the class of persons to which she belonged. they poured out the liquor   and made the most friendly gesticulations  while a cold perspiration  trickled down the back of the poor councillor.    “what's to be the end of this! what's to become of me!” groaned he  but  he was forced  in spite of his opposition  to drink with the rest. they  took hold of the worthy man  who  hearing on every side that he was  intoxicated  did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly  not very polite assertion  but on the contrary  implored the ladies  and gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they  however   imagined he was talking russian.    never before  he thought  had he been in such a coarse and ignorant  company  one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again.  “it is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued  against me!” but suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down  under the table  and then creep unobserved out of the door. he did so   but just as he was going  the others remarked what he was about  they  laid hold of him by the legs  and now  happily for him  off fell his  fatal shoes--and with them the charm was at an end.    the councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning  and  behind this a large handsome house. all seemed to him in proper order as  usual  it was east street  splendid and elegant as we now see it. he lay  with his feet towards a doorway  and exactly opposite sat the watchman  asleep.    “gracious heaven!” said he. “have i lain here in the street and dreamed?  yes  'tis east street! how splendid and light it is! but really it is  terrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!”    two minutes later  he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to  frederickshafen. he thought of the distress and agony he had endured   and praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality--our own  time--which  with all its deficiencies  is yet much better than that in  which  so much against his inclination  he had lately been.      iii. the watchman's adventure    “why  there is a pair of galoshes  as sure as i'm alive!” said the  watchman  awaking from a gentle slumber. “they belong no doubt to the  lieutenant who lives over the way. they lie close to the door.”    the worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house  for  there was still a light in the window  but he did not like disturbing  the other people in their beds  and so very considerately he left the  matter alone.    “such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable ” said he  “the  leather is so soft and supple.” they fitted his feet as though they  had been made for him. “'tis a curious world we live in ” continued he   soliloquizing. “there is the lieutenant  now  who might go quietly to  bed if he chose  where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease   but does he do it? no  he saunters up and down his room  because   probably  he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at  his dinner. that's a happy fellow! he has neither an infirm mother  nor  a whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him. every  evening he goes to a party  where his nice supper costs him nothing:  would to heaven i could but change with him! how happy should i be!”    while expressing his wish  the charm of the shoes  which he had put on   began to work  the watchman entered into the being and nature of the  lieutenant. he stood in the handsomely furnished apartment  and held  between his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper  on which some  verses were written--written indeed by the officer himself  for who has  not  at least once in his life  had a lyrical moment? and if one then  marks down one's thoughts  poetry is produced. but here was written:                      oh  were i rich!         “oh  were i rich! such was my wish  yea such        when hardly three feet high  i longed for much.         oh  were i rich! an officer were i          with sword  and uniform  and plume so high.         and the time came  and officer was i!       but yet i grew not rich. alas  poor me!       have pity  thou  who all man's wants dost see.            “i sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss         a maid of seven years old gave me a kiss          i at that time was rich in poesy         and tales of old  though poor as poor could be          but all she asked for was this poesy.       then was i rich  but not in gold  poor me!       as thou dost know  who all men's hearts canst see.            “oh  were i rich! oft asked i for this boon.        the child grew up to womanhood full soon.         she is so pretty  clever  and so kind       oh  did she know what's hidden in my mind--         a tale of old. would she to me were kind!       but i'm condemned to silence! oh  poor me!       as thou dost know  who all men's hearts canst see.            “oh  were i rich in calm and peace of mind         my grief you then would not here written find!         o thou  to whom i do my heart devote          oh read this page of glad days now remote          a dark  dark tale  which i tonight devote!       dark is the future now. alas  poor me!       have pity thou  who all men's pains dost see.”    such verses as these people write when they are in love! but no man  in his senses ever thinks of printing them. here one of the sorrows of  life  in which there is real poetry  gave itself vent  not that  barren grief which the poet may only hint at  but never depict in its  detail--misery and want: that animal necessity  in short  to snatch  at least at a fallen leaf of the bread-fruit tree  if not at the fruit  itself. the higher the position in which one finds oneself transplanted   the greater is the suffering. everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of  life--no lovely picture reflects itself therein. lieutenant  love  and  lack of money--that is a symbolic triangle  or much the same as the  half of the shattered die of fortune. this the lieutenant felt most  poignantly  and this was the reason he leant his head against the  window  and sighed so deeply.    “the poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than i. he  knows not what i term privation. he has a home  a wife  and children   who weep with him over his sorrows  who rejoice with him when he is  glad. oh  far happier were i  could i exchange with him my being--with  his desires and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life! oh   he is a hundred times happier than i!”    in the same moment the watchman was again watchman. it was the shoes  that caused the metamorphosis by means of which  unknown to himself  he  took upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer  but  as we have  just seen  he felt himself in his new situation much less contented   and now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had  rejected. so then the watchman was again watchman.    “that was an unpleasant dream ” said he  “but 'twas droll enough  altogether. i fancied that i was the lieutenant over there: and yet  the thing was not very much to my taste after all. i missed my good old  mother and the dear little ones  who almost tear me to pieces for sheer  love.”    he seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt  him  for he still had the shoes on his feet. a falling star shone in the  dark firmament.    “there falls another star ” said he: “but what does it matter  there  are always enough left. i should not much mind examining the little  glimmering things somewhat nearer  especially the moon  for that would  not slip so easily through a man's fingers. when we die--so at least  says the student  for whom my wife does the washing--we shall fly about  as light as a feather from one such a star to the other. that's  of  course  not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so. if i could  but once take a leap up there  my body might stay here on the steps for  what i care.”    behold--there are certain things in the world to which one ought never  to give utterance except with the greatest caution  but doubly careful  must one be when we have the shoes of fortune on our feet. now just  listen to what happened to the watchman.    as to ourselves  we all know the speed produced by the employment of  steam  we have experienced it either on railroads  or in boats when  crossing the sea  but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in  comparison with the velocity with which light moves. it flies nineteen  million times faster than the best race-horse  and yet electricity is  quicker still. death is an electric shock which our heart receives  the  freed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity. the sun's light  wants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than  twenty million of our danish [*] miles  borne by electricity  the soul  wants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight. to it the  space between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance  between the homes of our friends in town is for us  even if they live a  short way from each other  such an electric shock in the heart  however   costs us the use of the body here below  unless  like the watchman of  east street  we happen to have on the shoes of fortune.         * a danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 english.      in a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our  miles up to the moon  which  as everyone knows  was formed out of  matter much lighter than our earth  and is  so we should say  as soft  as newly-fallen snow. he found himself on one of the many circumjacent  mountain-ridges with which we are acquainted by means of dr. madler's  “map of the moon.” within  down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron   about a danish mile in depth  while below lay a town  whose appearance  we can  in some measure  realize to ourselves by beating the white of  an egg in a glass of water. the matter of which it was built was just as  soft  and formed similar towers  and domes  and pillars  transparent and  rocking in the thin air  while above his head our earth was rolling like  a large fiery ball.    he perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what  we call “men”  yet they looked different to us. a far more correct  imagination than that of the pseudo-herschel* had created them  and  if they had been placed in rank and file  and copied by some skilful  painter's hand  one would  without doubt  have exclaimed involuntarily   “what a beautiful arabesque!”    *this relates to a book published some years ago in germany  and said  to be by herschel  which contained a description of the moon and its  inhabitants  written with such a semblance of truth that many were  deceived by the imposture.    probably a translation of the celebrated moon hoax  written by richard  a. locke  and originally published in new york.      they had a language too  but surely nobody can expect that the soul of  the watchman should understand it. be that as it may  it did comprehend  it  for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor  mortals  despite all our cleverness  have any notion of. does she  not show us--she the queen in the land of enchantment--her astounding  dramatic talent in all our dreams? there every acquaintance appears and  speaks upon the stage  so entirely in character  and with the same tone  of voice  that none of us  when awake  were able to imitate it. how  well can she recall persons to our mind  of whom we have not thought for  years  when suddenly they step forth “every inch a man ” resembling the  real personages  even to the finest features  and become the heroes  or heroines of our world of dreams. in reality  such remembrances are  rather unpleasant: every sin  every evil thought  may  like a clock with  alarm or chimes  be repeated at pleasure  then the question is if we can  trust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word in our heart  and on our lips.    the watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the  moon pretty well. the selenites* disputed variously about our earth   and expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air  they said   must certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon  the necessary free respiration. they considered the moon alone to  be inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or  planetary system  on which the genuine cosmopolites  or citizens of the  world  dwelt. what strange things men--no  what strange things selenites  sometimes take into their heads!    * dwellers in the moon.      about politics they had a good deal to say. but little denmark must  take care what it is about  and not run counter to the moon  that  great realm  that might in an ill-humor bestir itself  and dash down a  hail-storm in our faces  or force the baltic to overflow the sides of  its gigantic basin.    we will  therefore  not listen to what was spoken  and on no condition  run in the possibility of telling tales out of school  but we will  rather proceed  like good quiet citizens  to east street  and observe  what happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.    he sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star * that is to say  the  heavy wooden staff  headed with iron spikes  and which had nothing else  in common with its sparkling brother in the sky  had glided from his  hand  while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon  looking  for the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.    *the watchmen in germany  had formerly  and in some places they still  carry with them  on their rounds at night  a sort of mace or club  known  in ancient times by the above denomination.      “what's the hour  watchman?” asked a passer-by. but when the watchman  gave no reply  the merry roysterer  who was now returning home from a  noisy drinking bout  took it into his head to try what a tweak of the  nose would do  on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance  the body  lay motionless  stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. when  the patrol came up  all his comrades  who comprehended nothing of the  whole affair  were seized with a dreadful fright  for dead he was   and he remained so. the proper authorities were informed of the  circumstance  people talked a good deal about it  and in the morning the  body was carried to the hospital.    now that would be a very pretty joke  if the spirit when it came back  and looked for the body in east street  were not to find one. no doubt  it would  in its anxiety  run off to the police  and then to the  “hue and cry” office  to announce that “the finder will be handsomely  rewarded ” and at last away to the hospital  yet we may boldly assert  that the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter  and every  sort of leading-string--the body only makes it stupid.    the seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered  as we have said  to  the hospital  where it was brought into the general viewing-room:  and the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the  galoshes--when the spirit  that was merely gone out on adventures  must  have returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement.  it took its direction towards the body in a straight line  and a few  seconds after  life began to show itself in the man. he asserted that  the preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had  allotted him  he would not for two silver marks again go through what he  had endured while moon-stricken  but now  however  it was over.    the same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured  but  the shoes meanwhile remained behind.      iv. a moment of head importance--an evening's “dramatic readings”--a  most strange journey    every inhabitant of copenhagen knows  from personal inspection  how  the entrance to frederick's hospital looks  but as it is possible that  others  who are not copenhagen people  may also read this little work   we will beforehand give a short description of it.    the extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high  railing  the thick iron bars of which are so far apart  that in  all seriousness  it is said  some very thin fellow had of a night  occasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits  in the town. the part of the body most difficult to manage on such  occasions was  no doubt  the head  here  as is so often the case in  the world  long-headed people get through best. so much  then  for the  introduction.    one of the young men  whose head  in a physical sense only  might be  said to be of the thickest  had the watch that evening. the rain poured  down in torrents  yet despite these two obstacles  the young man was  obliged to go out  if it were but for a quarter of an hour  and as  to telling the door-keeper about it  that  he thought  was quite  unnecessary  if  with a whole skin  he were able to slip through the  railings. there  on the floor lay the galoshes  which the watchman  had forgotten  he never dreamed for a moment that they were those of  fortune  and they promised to do him good service in the wet  so he put  them on. the question now was  if he could squeeze himself through the  grating  for he had never tried before. well  there he stood.    “would to heaven i had got my head through!” said he  involuntarily  and  instantly through it slipped  easily and without pain  notwithstanding  it was pretty large and thick. but now the rest of the body was to be  got through!    “ah! i am much too stout ” groaned he aloud  while fixed as in a vice.  “i had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matter--oh!  oh! i really cannot squeeze myself through!”    he now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again  but he could not.  for his neck there was room enough  but for nothing more. his first  feeling was of anger  his next that his temper fell to zero. the  shoes of fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation  and   unfortunately  it never occurred to him to wish himself free. the  pitch-black clouds poured down their contents in still heavier torrents   not a creature was to be seen in the streets. to reach up to the bell  was what he did not like  to cry aloud for help would have availed him  little  besides  how ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a  trap  like an outwitted fox! how was he to twist himself through! he saw  clearly that it was his irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till  dawn  or  perhaps  even late in the morning  then the smith must be  fetched to file away the bars  but all that would not be done so quickly  as he could think about it. the whole charity school  just opposite   would be in motion  all the new booths  with their not very  courtier-like swarm of seamen  would join them out of curiosity  and  would greet him with a wild “hurrah!” while he was standing in his  pillory: there would be a mob  a hissing  and rejoicing  and jeering   ten times worse than in the rows about the jews some years ago--“oh  my  blood is mounting to my brain  'tis enough to drive one mad! i shall go  wild! i know not what to do. oh! were i but loose  my dizziness would  then cease  oh  were my head but loose!”    you see he ought to have said that sooner  for the moment he expressed  the wish his head was free  and cured of all his paroxysms of love  he  hastened off to his room  where the pains consequent on the fright the  shoes had prepared for him  did not so soon take their leave.    but you must not think that the affair is over now  it grows much worse.    the night passed  the next day also  but nobody came to fetch the shoes.    in the evening “dramatic readings” were to be given at the little  theatre in king street. the house was filled to suffocation  and among  other pieces to be recited was a new poem by h. c. andersen  called  my  aunt's spectacles  the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:    “a certain person had an aunt  who boasted of particular skill in  fortune-telling with cards  and who was constantly being stormed by  persons that wanted to have a peep into futurity. but she was full of  mystery about her art  in which a certain pair of magic spectacles  did her essential service. her nephew  a merry boy  who was his aunt's  darling  begged so long for these spectacles  that  at last  she lent  him the treasure  after having informed him  with many exhortations   that in order to execute the interesting trick  he need only repair to  some place where a great many persons were assembled  and then  from a  higher position  whence he could overlook the crowd  pass the company in  review before him through his spectacles. immediately 'the inner man' of  each individual would be displayed before him  like a game of cards  in  which he unerringly might read what the future of every person presented  was to be. well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the  powers of the spectacles in the theatre  no place seeming to him more  fitted for such a trial. he begged permission of the worthy audience   and set his spectacles on his nose. a motley phantasmagoria presents  itself before him  which he describes in a few satirical touches  yet  without expressing his opinion openly: he tells the people enough to set  them all thinking and guessing  but in order to hurt nobody  he wraps  his witty oracular judgments in a transparent veil  or rather in a lurid  thundercloud  shooting forth bright sparks of wit  that they may fall in  the powder-magazine of the expectant audience.”    the humorous poem was admirably recited  and the speaker much applauded.  among the audience was the young man of the hospital  who seemed to have  forgotten his adventure of the preceding night. he had on the shoes  for  as yet no lawful owner had appeared to claim them  and besides it was so  very dirty out-of-doors  they were just the thing for him  he thought.    the beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even  found the idea original and effective. but that the end of it  like the  rhine  was very insignificant  proved  in his opinion  the author's  want of invention  he was without genius  etc. this was an excellent  opportunity to have said something clever.    meanwhile he was haunted by the idea--he should like to possess such a  pair of spectacles himself  then  perhaps  by using them circumspectly   one would be able to look into people's hearts  which  he thought  would  be far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year   for that we should all know in proper time  but the other never.    “i can now ” said he to himself  “fancy the whole row of ladies and  gentlemen sitting there in the front row  if one could but see into  their hearts--yes  that would be a revelation--a sort of bazar. in that  lady yonder  so strangely dressed  i should find for certain a large  milliner's shop  in that one the shop is empty  but it wants cleaning  plain enough. but there would also be some good stately shops among  them. alas!” sighed he  “i know one in which all is stately  but there  sits already a spruce young shopman  which is the only thing that's  amiss in the whole shop. all would be splendidly decked out  and we  should hear  'walk in  gentlemen  pray walk in  here you will find all  you please to want.' ah! i wish to heaven i could walk in and take a  trip right through the hearts of those present!”    and behold! to the shoes of fortune this was the cue  the whole man  shrunk together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the  front row of spectators  now began. the first heart through which he  came  was that of a middle-aged lady  but he instantly fancied himself  in the room of the “institution for the cure of the crooked and  deformed ” where casts of mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked  reality on the wall. yet there was this difference  in the institution  the casts were taken at the entry of the patient  but here they were  retained and guarded in the heart while the sound persons went away.  they were  namely  casts of female friends  whose bodily or mental  deformities were here most faithfully preserved.    with the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female  heart  but this seemed to him like a large holy fane. [*] the white dove of  innocence fluttered over the altar. how gladly would he have sunk upon  his knees  but he must away to the next heart  yet he still heard the  pealing tones of the organ  and he himself seemed to have become a newer  and a better man  he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary  which a poor garret  with a sick bed-rid mother  revealed. but god's  warm sun streamed through the open window  lovely roses nodded from  the wooden flower-boxes on the roof  and two sky-blue birds sang  rejoicingly  while the sick mother implored god's richest blessings on  her pious daughter.         * temple      he now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop  at least on  every side  and above and below  there was nought but flesh. it was the  heart of a most respectable rich man  whose name is certain to be found  in the directory.    he was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. it was an  old  dilapidated  mouldering dovecot. the husband's portrait was used as  a weather-cock  which was connected in some way or other with the doors   and so they opened and shut of their own accord  whenever the stern old  husband turned round.    hereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors  like  the one in castle rosenburg  but here the glasses magnified to an  astonishing degree. on the floor  in the middle of the room  sat  like a  dalai-lama  the insignificant “self” of the person  quite confounded at  his own greatness. he then imagined he had got into a needle-case full  of pointed needles of every size.    “this is certainly the heart of an old maid ” thought he. but he was  mistaken. it was the heart of a young military man  a man  as people  said  of talent and feeling.    in the greatest perplexity  he now came out of the last heart in the  row  he was unable to put his thoughts in order  and fancied that his  too lively imagination had run away with him.    “good heavens!” sighed he. “i have surely a disposition to madness--'tis  dreadfully hot here  my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning  like a coal.” and he now remembered the important event of the evening  before  how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the  hospital. “that's what it is  no doubt ” said he. “i must do something  in time: under such circumstances a russian bath might do me good. i  only wish i were already on the upper bank.” [*]         *in these russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself       on a bank or form  and as he gets accustomed to the heat        moves to another higher up towards the ceiling  where  of       course  the vapor is warmest. in this manner he ascends       gradually to the highest.    and so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath  but with  all his clothes on  in his boots and galoshes  while the hot drops fell  scalding from the ceiling on his face.    “holloa!” cried he  leaping down. the bathing attendant  on his side   uttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath  a man  completely dressed.    the other  however  retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to  him  “'tis a bet  and i have won it!” but the first thing he did as soon  as he got home  was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to  draw out his madness.    the next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back  and  excepting  the fright  that was all that he had gained by the shoes of fortune.      v. metamorphosis of the copying-clerk    the watchman  whom we have certainly not forgotten  thought meanwhile  of the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital  he now  went to fetch them  and as neither the lieutenant  nor anybody else in  the street  claimed them as his property  they were delivered over to  the police-office.*    *as on the continent  in all law and police practices nothing is verbal   but any circumstance  however trifling  is reduced to writing  the  labor  as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate  is  enormous. in a police-office  consequently  we find copying-clerks among  many other scribes of various denominations  of which  it seems  our  hero was one.      “why  i declare the shoes look just like my own ” said one of the  clerks  eying the newly-found treasure  whose hidden powers  even he   sharp as he was  was not able to discover. “one must have more than  the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other ” said he   soliloquizing  and putting  at the same time  the galoshes in search of  an owner  beside his own in the corner.    “here  sir!” said one of the men  who panting brought him a tremendous  pile of papers.    the copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the  reports and legal documents in question  but when he had finished  and  his eye fell again on the shoes  he was unable to say whether those to  the left or those to the right belonged to him. “at all events it must  be those which are wet ” thought he  but this time  in spite of his  cleverness  he guessed quite wrong  for it was just those of fortune  which played as it were into his hands  or rather on his feet. and why   i should like to know  are the police never to be wrong? so he put them  on quickly  stuck his papers in his pocket  and took besides a few under  his arm  intending to look them through at home to make the necessary  notes. it was noon  and the weather  that had threatened rain  began  to clear up  while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. “a  little trip to fredericksburg would do me no great harm ” thought he   “for i  poor beast of burden that i am  have so much to annoy me  that i  don't know what a good appetite is. 'tis a bitter crust  alas! at which  i am condemned to gnaw!”    nobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man  we therefore  wish him joy of the excursion with all our heart  and it will certainly  be beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life. in the park  he met a friend  one of our young poets  who told him that the following  day he should set out on his long-intended tour.    “so you are going away again!” said the clerk. “you are a very free  and happy being  we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our  desk.”    “yes  but it is a chain  friend  which ensures you the blessed bread  of existence ” answered the poet. “you need feel no care for the coming  morrow: when you are old  you receive a pension.”    “true ” said the clerk  shrugging his shoulders  “and yet you are  the better off. to sit at one's ease and poetise--that is a pleasure   everybody has something agreeable to say to you  and you are always your  own master. no  friend  you should but try what it is to sit from one  year's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial  matters.”    the poet shook his head  the copying-clerk did the same. each one kept  to his own opinion  and so they separated.    “it's a strange race  those poets!” said the clerk  who was very fond of  soliloquizing. “i should like some day  just for a trial  to take such  nature upon me  and be a poet myself  i am very sure i should make  no such miserable verses as the others. today  methinks  is a most  delicious day for a poet. nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening  into life. the air is so unusually clear  the clouds sail on so  buoyantly  and from the green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills  me with delight. for many a year have i not felt as at this moment.”    we see already  by the foregoing effusion  that he is become a poet  to  give further proof of it  however  would in most cases be insipid  for  it is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men.  among the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an  acknowledged poet  when examined more closely  could boast of  the  difference only is  that the poet possesses a better mental memory  on  which account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they  can be embodied by means of words  a faculty which the others do not  possess. but the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is  richly endowed  demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a  certain abyss which yawns threateningly below  and thus must the sudden  change with the clerk strike the reader.    “the sweet air!” continued he of the police-office  in his dreamy  imaginings  “how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt  magdalena! yes  then i was a little wild boy  who did not go to school  very regularly. o heavens! 'tis a long time since i have thought on  those times. the good old soul! she lived behind the exchange. she  always had a few twigs or green shoots in water--let the winter rage  without as it might. the violets exhaled their sweet breath  whilst i  pressed against the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the  copper coin i had heated on the stove  and so made peep-holes.  what splendid vistas were then opened to my view! what change--what  magnificence! yonder in the canal lay the ships frozen up  and deserted  by their whole crews  with a screaming crow for the sole occupant. but  when the spring  with a gentle stirring motion  announced her arrival   a new and busy life arose  with songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn  asunder  the ships were fresh tarred and rigged  that they might sail  away to distant lands. but i have remained here--must always remain  here  sitting at my desk in the office  and patiently see other people  fetch their passports to go abroad. such is my fate! alas!”--sighed he   and was again silent. “great heaven! what is come to me! never have i  thought or felt like this before! it must be the summer air that affects  me with feelings almost as disquieting as they are refreshing.”    he felt in his pocket for the papers. “these police-reports will soon  stem the torrent of my ideas  and effectually hinder any rebellious  overflowing of the time-worn banks of official duties”  he said to  himself consolingly  while his eye ran over the first page. “dame  tigbrith  tragedy in five acts.” “what is that? and yet it is undeniably  my own handwriting. have i written the tragedy? wonderful  very  wonderful!--and this--what have i here? 'intrigue on the ramparts  or  the day of repentance: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite  airs.' the deuce! where did i get all this rubbish? some one must have  slipped it slyly into my pocket for a joke. there is too a letter to me   a crumpled letter and the seal broken.”    yes  it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre  in  which both pieces were flatly refused.    “hem! hem!” said the clerk breathlessly  and quite exhausted he seated  himself on a bank. his thoughts were so elastic  his heart so tender   and involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers. it is a simple  daisy  just bursting out of the bud. what the botanist tells us after  a number of imperfect lectures  the flower proclaimed in a minute. it  related the mythus of its birth  told of the power of the sun-light that  spread out its delicate leaves  and forced them to impregnate the air  with their incense--and then he thought of the manifold struggles of  life  which in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our  bosom. light and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of  the fair flower that bestowed her chief favors on the latter  full of  longing she turned towards the light  and as soon as it vanished  rolled  her tender leaves together and slept in the embraces of the air. “it is  the light which adorns me ” said the flower.    “but 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe ” said the poet's voice.    close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. the drops of  water splashed up to the green leafy roof  and the clerk thought of the  million of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height   that was as great doubtless for their size  as for us if we were to  be hurled above the clouds. while he thought of this and of the whole  metamorphosis he had undergone  he smiled and said  “i sleep and dream   but it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally  and know besides so  exactly that it is but a dream. if only to-morrow on awaking  i could  again call all to mind so vividly! i seem in unusually good spirits  my  perception of things is clear  i feel as light and cheerful as though  i were in heaven  but i know for a certainty  that if to-morrow a dim  remembrance of it should swim before my mind  it will then seem nothing  but stupid nonsense  as i have often experienced already--especially  before i enlisted under the banner of the police  for that dispels like  a whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. all we hear  or say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the  subterranean spirits  it is rich and splendid when it is given us  but  viewed by daylight we find only withered leaves. alas!” he sighed quite  sorrowful  and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from  branch to branch  “they are much better off than i! to fly must be a  heavenly art  and happy do i prize that creature in which it is innate.  yes! could i exchange my nature with any other creature  i fain would be  such a happy little lark!”    he had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves  of his coat folded themselves together into wings  the clothes became  feathers  and the galoshes claws. he observed it perfectly  and laughed  in his heart. “now then  there is no doubt that i am dreaming  but i  never before was aware of such mad freaks as these.” and up he flew into  the green roof and sang  but in the song there was no poetry  for the  spirit of the poet was gone. the shoes  as is the case with anybody who  does what he has to do properly  could only attend to one thing at a  time. he wanted to be a poet  and he was one  he now wished to be a  merry chirping bird: but when he was metamorphosed into one  the former  peculiarities ceased immediately. “it is really pleasant enough ” said  he: “the whole day long i sit in the office amid the driest  law-papers  and at night i fly in my dream as a lark in the gardens of  fredericksburg  one might really write a very pretty comedy upon it.” he  now fluttered down into the grass  turned his head gracefully on every  side  and with his bill pecked the pliant blades of grass  which  in  comparison to his present size  seemed as majestic as the palm-branches  of northern africa.    unfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. presently black night  overshadowed our enthusiast  who had so entirely missed his part of  copying-clerk at a police-office  some vast object seemed to be thrown  over him. it was a large oil-skin cap  which a sailor-boy of the quay  had thrown over the struggling bird  a coarse hand sought its way  carefully in under the broad rim  and seized the clerk over the back  and wings. in the first moment of fear  he called  indeed  as loud as  he could--“you impudent little blackguard! i am a copying-clerk at  the police-office  and you know you cannot insult any belonging to the  constabulary force without a chastisement. besides  you good-for-nothing  rascal  it is strictly forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of  fredericksburg  but your blue uniform betrays where you come from.”   this fine tirade sounded  however  to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere  “pippi-pi.” he gave the noisy bird a knock on his beak  and walked on.    he was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper class--that is to say as  individuals  for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class  in the school  and they bought the stupid bird. so the copying-clerk  came to copenhagen as guest  or rather as prisoner in a family living in  gother street.    “'tis well that i'm dreaming ” said the clerk  “or i really should get  angry. first i was a poet  now sold for a few pence as a lark  no doubt  it was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me  into such a poor harmless little creature. it is really pitiable   particularly when one gets into the hands of a little blackguard   perfect in all sorts of cruelty to animals: all i should like to know  is  how the story will end.”    the two schoolboys  the proprietors now of the transformed clerk   carried him into an elegant room. a stout stately dame received them  with a smile  but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common  field-bird  as she called the lark  should appear in such high society.  for to-day  however  she would allow it  and they must shut him in the  empty cage that was standing in the window. “perhaps he will amuse my  good polly ” added the lady  looking with a benignant smile at a large  green parrot that swung himself backwards and forwards most comfortably  in his ring  inside a magnificent brass-wired cage. “to-day is polly's  birthday ” said she with stupid simplicity: “and the little brown  field-bird must wish him joy.”    mr. polly uttered not a syllable in reply  but swung to and fro with  dignified condescension  while a pretty canary  as yellow as gold  that  had lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home  began to sing  aloud.    “noisy creature! will you be quiet!” screamed the lady of the house   covering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief.    “chirp  chirp!” sighed he. “that was a dreadful snowstorm”  and he  sighed again  and was silent.    the copying-clerk  or  as the lady said  the brown field-bird  was  put into a small cage  close to the canary  and not far from “my good  polly.” the only human sounds that the parrot could bawl out  were  “come  let us be men!” everything else that he said was as  unintelligible to everybody as the chirping of the canary  except to the  clerk  who was now a bird too: he understood his companion perfectly.    “i flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees ”   sang the canary  “i flew around  with my brothers and sisters  over  the beautiful flowers  and over the glassy lakes  where the bright  water-plants nodded to me from below. there  too  i saw many  splendidly-dressed paroquets  that told the drollest stories  and the  wildest fairy tales without end.”    “oh! those were uncouth birds ” answered the parrot. “they had no  education  and talked of whatever came into their head.    “if my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what i say  so may you  too  i should think. it is a great fault to have no taste for what is  witty or amusing--come  let us be men.”    “ah  you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that  danced beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers?  do you no longer remember the sweet fruits  and the cooling juice in  the wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?” said the former  inhabitant of the canary isles  continuing his dithyrambic.    “oh  yes ” said the parrot  “but i am far better off here. i am well  fed  and get friendly treatment. i know i am a clever fellow  and that  is all i care about. come  let us be men. you are of a poetical nature   as it is called--i  on the contrary  possess profound knowledge and  inexhaustible wit. you have genius  but clear-sighted  calm discretion  does not take such lofty flights  and utter such high natural tones.  for this they have covered you over--they never do the like to me  for  i cost more. besides  they are afraid of my beak  and i have always a  witty answer at hand. come  let us be men!”    “o warm spicy land of my birth ” sang the canary bird  “i will sing of  thy dark-green bowers  of the calm bays where the pendent boughs  kiss the surface of the water  i will sing of the rejoicing of all my  brothers and sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance.”    “spare us your elegiac tones ” said the parrot giggling. “rather speak  of something at which one may laugh heartily. laughing is an infallible  sign of the highest degree of mental development. can a dog  or a horse  laugh? no  but they can cry. the gift of laughing was given to man  alone. ha! ha! ha!” screamed polly  and added his stereotype witticism.  “come  let us be men!”    “poor little danish grey-bird ” said the canary  “you have been caught  too. it is  no doubt  cold enough in your woods  but there at least  is the breath of liberty  therefore fly away. in the hurry they have  forgotten to shut your cage  and the upper window is open. fly  my  friend  fly away. farewell!”    instinctively the clerk obeyed  with a few strokes of his wings he was  out of the cage  but at the same moment the door  which was only ajar   and which led to the next room  began to creak  and supple and creeping  came the large tomcat into the room  and began to pursue him. the  frightened canary fluttered about in his cage  the parrot flapped his  wings  and cried  “come  let us be men!” the clerk felt a mortal fright   and flew through the window  far away over the houses and streets. at  last he was forced to rest a little.    the neighboring house had a something familiar about it  a window stood  open  he flew in  it was his own room. he perched upon the table.    “come  let us be men!” said he  involuntarily imitating the chatter of  the parrot  and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk  but he  was sitting in the middle of the table.    “heaven help me!” cried he. “how did i get up here--and so buried in  sleep  too? after all  that was a very unpleasant  disagreeable dream  that haunted me! the whole story is nothing but silly  stupid nonsense!”      vi. the best that the galoshes gave    the following day  early in the morning  while the clerk was still in  bed  someone knocked at his door. it was his neighbor  a young divine   who lived on the same floor. he walked in.    “lend me your galoshes ” said he  “it is so wet in the garden  though  the sun is shining most invitingly. i should like to go out a little.”    he got the galoshes  and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden   where between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were  standing. even such a little garden as this was considered in the  metropolis of copenhagen as a great luxury.    the young man wandered up and down the narrow paths  as well as the  prescribed limits would allow  the clock struck six  without was heard  the horn of a post-boy.    “to travel! to travel!” exclaimed he  overcome by most painful and  passionate remembrances. “that is the happiest thing in the world! that  is the highest aim of all my wishes! then at last would the agonizing  restlessness be allayed  which destroys my existence! but it must be  far  far away! i would behold magnificent switzerland  i would travel to  italy  and--”    it was a good thing that the power of the galoshes worked as  instantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do  otherwise  the poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about  the world too much for himself as well as for us. in short  he was  travelling. he was in the middle of switzerland  but packed up with  eight other passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence   his head ached till it almost split  his weary neck could hardly bear  the heavy load  and his feet  pinched by his torturing boots  were  terribly swollen. he was in an intermediate state between sleeping and  waking  at variance with himself  with his company  with the country   and with the government. in his right pocket he had his letter of  credit  in the left  his passport  and in a small leathern purse some  double louis d'or  carefully sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat.  every dream proclaimed that one or the other of these valuables was  lost  wherefore he started up as in a fever  and the first movement  which his hand made  described a magic triangle from the right pocket to  the left  and then up towards the bosom  to feel if he had them all safe  or not. from the roof inside the carriage  umbrellas  walking-sticks   hats  and sundry other articles were depending  and hindered the view   which was particularly imposing. he now endeavored as well as he  was able to dispel his gloom  which was caused by outward chance  circumstances merely  and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of  purest human enjoyment.    grand  solemn  and dark was the whole landscape around. the gigantic  pine-forests  on the pointed crags  seemed almost like little tufts of  heather  colored by the surrounding clouds. it began to snow  a cold  wind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride.    “augh!” sighed he  “were we only on the other side the alps  then we  should have summer  and i could get my letters of credit cashed. the  anxiety i feel about them prevents me enjoying switzerland. were i but  on the other side!”    and so saying he was on the other side in italy  between florence and  rome. lake thracymene  illumined by the evening sun  lay like flaming  gold between the dark-blue mountain-ridges  here  where hannibal  defeated flaminius  the rivers now held each other in their green  embraces  lovely  half-naked children tended a herd of black swine   beneath a group of fragrant laurel-trees  hard by the road-side.  could we render this inimitable picture properly  then would everybody  exclaim  “beautiful  unparalleled italy!” but neither the young divine  said so  nor anyone of his grumbling companions in the coach of the  vetturino.    the poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands  in vain one  waved myrtle-branches about like mad  the audacious insect population  did not cease to sting  nor was there a single person in the  well-crammed carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their  ravenous bites. the poor horses  tortured almost to death  suffered most  from this truly egyptian plague  the flies alighted upon them in large  disgusting swarms  and if the coachman got down and scraped them off   hardly a minute elapsed before they were there again. the sun now set: a  freezing cold  though of short duration pervaded the whole creation   it was like a horrid gust coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's  day--but all around the mountains retained that wonderful green tone  which we see in some old pictures  and which  should we not have seen a  similar play of color in the south  we declare at once to be unnatural.  it was a glorious prospect  but the stomach was empty  the body tired   all that the heart cared and longed for was good night-quarters  yet  how would they be? for these one looked much more anxiously than for the  charms of nature  which every where were so profusely displayed.    the road led through an olive-grove  and here the solitary inn was  situated. ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside. the  healthiest of them resembled  to use an expression of marryat's   “hunger's eldest son when he had come of age”  the others were either  blind  had withered legs and crept about on their hands  or withered  arms and fingerless hands. it was the most wretched misery  dragged  from among the filthiest rags. “excellenza  miserabili!” sighed they   thrusting forth their deformed limbs to view. even the hostess  with  bare feet  uncombed hair  and dressed in a garment of doubtful color   received the guests grumblingly. the doors were fastened with a loop of  string  the floor of the rooms presented a stone paving half torn  up  bats fluttered wildly about the ceiling  and as to the smell  therein--no--that was beyond description.    “you had better lay the cloth below in the stable ” said one of the  travellers  “there  at all events  one knows what one is breathing.”    the windows were quickly opened  to let in a little fresh air. quicker   however  than the breeze  the withered  sallow arms of the beggars were  thrust in  accompanied by the eternal whine of “miserabili  miserabili   excellenza!” on the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions   written in nearly every language of europe  some in verse  some in  prose  most of them not very laudatory of “bella italia.”    the meal was served. it consisted of a soup of salted water  seasoned  with pepper and rancid oil. the last ingredient played a very prominent  part in the salad  stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the  grand dish of the repast  the wine even was not without a disgusting  taste--it was like a medicinal draught.    at night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed  against the rickety doors. one of the travellers kept watch while the  others slept. the sentry was our young divine. how close it was in the  chamber! the heat oppressive to suffocation--the gnats hummed and stung  unceasingly--the “miserabili” without whined and moaned in their sleep.    “travelling would be agreeable enough ” said he groaning  “if one only  had no body  or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its  pilgrimage unhindered  whither the voice within might call it. wherever  i go  i am pursued by a longing that is insatiable--that i cannot  explain to myself  and that tears my very heart. i want something better  than what is but what is fled in an instant. but what is it  and where  is it to be found? yet  i know in reality what it is i wish for. oh!  most happy were i  could i but reach one aim--could but reach the  happiest of all!”    and as he spoke the word he was again in his home  the long white  curtains hung down from the windows  and in the middle of the floor  stood the black coffin  in it he lay in the sleep of death. his wish  was fulfilled--the body rested  while the spirit went unhindered on its  pilgrimage. “let no one deem himself happy before his end ” were the  words of solon  and here was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of  the old apothegm.    every corpse is a sphynx of immortality  here too on the black coffin  the sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two  days before:         “o mighty death! thy silence teaches nought          thou leadest only to the near grave's brink         is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?       do i instead of mounting only sink?         our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not         our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:        and for the sufferer there is nothing left       but the green mound that o'er the coffin lies.”    two figures were moving in the chamber. we knew them both  it was the  fairy of care  and the emissary of fortune. they both bent over the  corpse.    “do you now see ” said care  “what happiness your galoshes have brought  to mankind?”    “to him  at least  who slumbers here  they have brought an imperishable  blessing ” answered the other.    “ah no!” replied care. “he took his departure himself  he was not called  away. his mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the  treasures lying beyond this life  and which his destiny ordained he  should obtain. i will now confer a benefit on him.”    and she took the galoshes from his feet  his sleep of death was ended   and he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his  dread couch in all the vigor of youth. care vanished  and with her the  galoshes. she has no doubt taken them for herself  to keep them to all  eternity.          the fir tree    out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree. the place he had was a  very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air  there was enough  of that  and round him grew many large-sized comrades  pines as well as  firs. but the little fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.    he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air  he did not care  for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they  were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. the children often came  with a whole pitcher full of berries  or a long row of them threaded on  a straw  and sat down near the young tree and said  “oh  how pretty he  is! what a nice little fir!” but this was what the tree could not bear  to hear.    at the end of a year he had shot up a good deal  and after another year  he was another long bit taller  for with fir trees one can always tell  by the shoots how many years old they are.    “oh! were i but such a high tree as the others are ” sighed he. “then i  should be able to spread out my branches  and with the tops to look into  the wide world! then would the birds build nests among my branches: and  when there was a breeze  i could bend with as much stateliness as the  others!”    neither the sunbeams  nor the birds  nor the red clouds which morning  and evening sailed above him  gave the little tree any pleasure.    in winter  when the snow lay glittering on the ground  a hare would  often come leaping along  and jump right over the little tree. oh  that  made him so angry! but two winters were past  and in the third the tree  was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. “to grow and  grow  to get older and be tall ” thought the tree--“that  after all  is  the most delightful thing in the world!”    in autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest  trees. this happened every year  and the young fir tree  that had now  grown to a very comely size  trembled at the sight  for the magnificent  great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking  the branches were  lopped off  and the trees looked long and bare  they were hardly to be  recognised  and then they were laid in carts  and the horses dragged  them out of the wood.    where did they go to? what became of them?    in spring  when the swallows and the storks came  the tree asked them   “don't you know where they have been taken? have you not met them  anywhere?”    the swallows did not know anything about it  but the stork looked  musing  nodded his head  and said  “yes  i think i know  i met many  ships as i was flying hither from egypt  on the ships were magnificent  masts  and i venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.  i may congratulate you  for they lifted themselves on high most  majestically!”    “oh  were i but old enough to fly across the sea! but how does the sea  look in reality? what is it like?”    “that would take a long time to explain ” said the stork  and with these  words off he went.    “rejoice in thy growth!” said the sunbeams. “rejoice in thy vigorous  growth  and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!”    and the wind kissed the tree  and the dew wept tears over him  but the  fir understood it not.    when christmas came  quite young trees were cut down: trees which often  were not even as large or of the same age as this fir tree  who could  never rest  but always wanted to be off. these young trees  and they  were always the finest looking  retained their branches  they were laid  on carts  and the horses drew them out of the wood.    “where are they going to?” asked the fir. “they are not taller than  i  there was one indeed that was considerably shorter  and why do they  retain all their branches? whither are they taken?”    “we know! we know!” chirped the sparrows. “we have peeped in at the  windows in the town below! we know whither they are taken! the greatest  splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. we  peeped through the windows  and saw them planted in the middle of the  warm room and ornamented with the most splendid things  with gilded  apples  with gingerbread  with toys  and many hundred lights!”    “and then?” asked the fir tree  trembling in every bough. “and then?  what happens then?”    “we did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.”    “i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career ” cried  the tree  rejoicing. “that is still better than to cross the sea! what  a longing do i suffer! were christmas but come! i am now tall  and my  branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! oh!  were i but already on the cart! were i in the warm room with all the  splendor and magnificence! yes  then something better  something still  grander  will surely follow  or wherefore should they thus ornament me?  something better  something still grander must follow--but what? oh  how  i long  how i suffer! i do not know myself what is the matter with me!”    “rejoice in our presence!” said the air and the sunlight. “rejoice in  thy own fresh youth!”    but the tree did not rejoice at all  he grew and grew  and was green  both winter and summer. people that saw him said  “what a fine tree!”   and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. the axe  struck deep into the very pith  the tree fell to the earth with a sigh   he felt a pang--it was like a swoon  he could not think of happiness   for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home  from the place  where he had sprung up. he well knew that he should never see his dear  old comrades  the little bushes and flowers around him  anymore  perhaps  not even the birds! the departure was not at all agreeable.    the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with  the other trees  and heard a man say  “that one is splendid! we don't  want the others.” then two servants came in rich livery and carried the  fir tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. portraits were hanging  on the walls  and near the white porcelain stove stood two large chinese  vases with lions on the covers. there  too  were large easy-chairs   silken sofas  large tables full of picture-books and full of toys  worth  hundreds and hundreds of crowns--at least the children said so. and the  fir tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand  but no  one could see that it was a cask  for green cloth was hung all round it   and it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. oh! how the tree quivered!  what was to happen? the servants  as well as the young ladies  decorated  it. on one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper  and  each net was filled with sugarplums  and among the other boughs gilded  apples and walnuts were suspended  looking as though they had grown  there  and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves.  dolls that looked for all the world like men--the tree had never beheld  such before--were seen among the foliage  and at the very top a  large star of gold tinsel was fixed. it was really splendid--beyond  description splendid.    “this evening!” they all said. “how it will shine this evening!”    “oh!” thought the tree. “if the evening were but come! if the tapers  were but lighted! and then i wonder what will happen! perhaps the other  trees from the forest will come to look at me! perhaps the sparrows will  beat against the windowpanes! i wonder if i shall take root here  and  winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!”    he knew very much about the matter--but he was so impatient that for  sheer longing he got a pain in his back  and this with trees is the same  thing as a headache with us.    the candles were now lighted--what brightness! what splendor! the  tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the  foliage. it blazed up famously.    “help! help!” cried the young ladies  and they quickly put out the fire.    now the tree did not even dare tremble. what a state he was in! he was  so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor  that he was  quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness  when suddenly both  folding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would  upset the tree. the older persons followed quietly  the little ones  stood quite still. but it was only for a moment  then they shouted that  the whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing  they danced round the  tree  and one present after the other was pulled off.    “what are they about?” thought the tree. “what is to happen now!” and  the lights burned down to the very branches  and as they burned down  they were put out one after the other  and then the children had  permission to plunder the tree. so they fell upon it with such violence  that all its branches cracked  if it had not been fixed firmly in the  ground  it would certainly have tumbled down.    the children danced about with their beautiful playthings  no one looked  at the tree except the old nurse  who peeped between the branches  but  it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been  forgotten.    “a story! a story!” cried the children  drawing a little fat man towards  the tree. he seated himself under it and said  “now we are in the shade   and the tree can listen too. but i shall tell only one story. now which  will you have  that about ivedy-avedy  or about humpy-dumpy  who  tumbled downstairs  and yet after all came to the throne and married the  princess?”    “ivedy-avedy ” cried some  “humpy-dumpy ” cried the others. there was  such a bawling and screaming--the fir tree alone was silent  and he  thought to himself  “am i not to bawl with the rest? am i to do nothing  whatever?” for he was one of the company  and had done what he had to  do.    and the man told about humpy-dumpy that tumbled down  who  notwithstanding came to the throne  and at last married the princess.  and the children clapped their hands  and cried. “oh  go on! do go on!”   they wanted to hear about ivedy-avedy too  but the little man only told  them about humpy-dumpy. the fir tree stood quite still and absorbed  in thought  the birds in the wood had never related the like of this.  “humpy-dumpy fell downstairs  and yet he married the princess! yes  yes!  that's the way of the world!” thought the fir tree  and believed it all   because the man who told the story was so good-looking. “well  well! who  knows  perhaps i may fall downstairs  too  and get a princess as wife!”   and he looked forward with joy to the morrow  when he hoped to be decked  out again with lights  playthings  fruits  and tinsel.    “i won't tremble to-morrow!” thought the fir tree. “i will enjoy to  the full all my splendor! to-morrow i shall hear again the story of  humpy-dumpy  and perhaps that of ivedy-avedy too.” and the whole night  the tree stood still and in deep thought.    in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.    “now then the splendor will begin again ” thought the fir. but they  dragged him out of the room  and up the stairs into the loft: and here   in a dark corner  where no daylight could enter  they left him. “what's  the meaning of this?” thought the tree. “what am i to do here? what  shall i hear now  i wonder?” and he leaned against the wall lost in  reverie. time enough had he too for his reflections  for days and nights  passed on  and nobody came up  and when at last somebody did come  it  was only to put some great trunks in a corner  out of the way. there  stood the tree quite hidden  it seemed as if he had been entirely  forgotten.    “'tis now winter out-of-doors!” thought the tree. “the earth is hard and  covered with snow  men cannot plant me now  and therefore i have been  put up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! how thoughtful  that is! how kind man is  after all! if it only were not so dark here   and so terribly lonely! not even a hare! and out in the woods it was  so pleasant  when the snow was on the ground  and the hare leaped by   yes--even when he jumped over me  but i did not like it then! it is  really terribly lonely here!”    “squeak! squeak!” said a little mouse  at the same moment  peeping out  of his hole. and then another little one came. they snuffed about the  fir tree  and rustled among the branches.    “it is dreadfully cold ” said the mouse. “but for that  it would be  delightful here  old fir  wouldn't it?”    “i am by no means old ” said the fir tree. “there's many a one  considerably older than i am.”    “where do you come from ” asked the mice  “and what can you do?” they  were so extremely curious. “tell us about the most beautiful spot on the  earth. have you never been there? were you never in the larder  where  cheeses lie on the shelves  and hams hang from above  where one dances  about on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean  and comes out  again fat and portly?”    “i know no such place ” said the tree. “but i know the wood  where the  sun shines and where the little birds sing.” and then he told all about  his youth  and the little mice had never heard the like before  and they  listened and said     “well  to be sure! how much you have seen! how happy you must have  been!”    “i!” said the fir tree  thinking over what he had himself related.  “yes  in reality those were happy times.” and then he told about  christmas-eve  when he was decked out with cakes and candles.    “oh ” said the little mice  “how fortunate you have been  old fir tree!”    “i am by no means old ” said he. “i came from the wood this winter  i am  in my prime  and am only rather short for my age.”    “what delightful stories you know ” said the mice: and the next night  they came with four other little mice  who were to hear what the tree  recounted: and the more he related  the more he remembered himself  and  it appeared as if those times had really been happy times. “but they may  still come--they may still come! humpy-dumpy fell downstairs  and yet  he got a princess!” and he thought at the moment of a nice little birch  tree growing out in the woods: to the fir  that would be a real charming  princess.    “who is humpy-dumpy?” asked the mice. so then the fir tree told the  whole fairy tale  for he could remember every single word of it  and the  little mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the tree. next night  two more mice came  and on sunday two rats even  but they said the  stories were not interesting  which vexed the little mice  and they   too  now began to think them not so very amusing either.    “do you know only one story?” asked the rats.    “only that one ” answered the tree. “i heard it on my happiest evening   but i did not then know how happy i was.”    “it is a very stupid story! don't you know one about bacon and tallow  candles? can't you tell any larder stories?”    “no ” said the tree.    “then good-bye ” said the rats  and they went home.    at last the little mice stayed away also  and the tree sighed: “after  all  it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me  and  listened to what i told them. now that too is over. but i will take good  care to enjoy myself when i am brought out again.”    but when was that to be? why  one morning there came a quantity of  people and set to work in the loft. the trunks were moved  the tree was  pulled out and thrown--rather hard  it is true--down on the floor  but a  man drew him towards the stairs  where the daylight shone.    “now a merry life will begin again ” thought the tree. he felt the fresh  air  the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. all passed  so quickly  there was so much going on around him  the tree quite forgot  to look to himself. the court adjoined a garden  and all was in flower   the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade  the lindens  were in blossom  the swallows flew by  and said  “quirre-vit! my husband  is come!” but it was not the fir tree that they meant.    “now  then  i shall really enjoy life ” said he exultingly  and spread  out his branches  but  alas  they were all withered and yellow! it was  in a corner that he lay  among weeds and nettles. the golden star of  tinsel was still on the top of the tree  and glittered in the sunshine.    in the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced  at christmas round the fir tree  and were so glad at the sight of him.  one of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.    “only look what is still on the ugly old christmas tree!” said he   trampling on the branches  so that they all cracked beneath his feet.    and the tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers  and the freshness in  the garden  he beheld himself  and wished he had remained in his dark  corner in the loft  he thought of his first youth in the wood  of the  merry christmas-eve  and of the little mice who had listened with so  much pleasure to the story of humpy-dumpy.    “'tis over--'tis past!” said the poor tree. “had i but rejoiced when i  had reason to do so! but now 'tis past  'tis past!”    and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces  there was a  whole heap lying there. the wood flamed up splendidly under the large  brewing copper  and it sighed so deeply! each sigh was like a shot.    the boys played about in the court  and the youngest wore the gold star  on his breast which the tree had had on the happiest evening of his  life. however  that was over now--the tree gone  the story at an end.  all  all was over--every tale must end at last.          the snow queen    first story. which treats of a mirror and of the splinters    now then  let us begin. when we are at the end of the story  we shall  know more than we know now: but to begin.    once upon a time there was a wicked sprite  indeed he was the most  mischievous of all sprites. one day he was in a very good humor  for  he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and  beautiful when it was reflected therein  to look poor and mean  but  that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified  and increased in ugliness. in this mirror the most beautiful landscapes  looked like boiled spinach  and the best persons were turned into  frights  or appeared to stand on their heads  their faces were so  distorted that they were not to be recognised  and if anyone had a mole   you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose  and mouth.    “that's glorious fun!” said the sprite. if a good thought passed through  a man's mind  then a grin was seen in the mirror  and the sprite laughed  heartily at his clever discovery. all the little sprites who went to his  school--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had  happened  and that now only  as they thought  it would be possible to  see how the world really looked. they ran about with the mirror  and at  last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted  in the mirror. so then they thought they would fly up to the sky   and have a joke there. the higher they flew with the mirror  the more  terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. higher and higher  still they flew  nearer and nearer to the stars  when suddenly the  mirror shook so terribly with grinning  that it flew out of their hands  and fell to the earth  where it was dashed in a hundred million and more  pieces. and now it worked much more evil than before  for some of these  pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand  and they flew about in  the wide world  and when they got into people's eyes  there they stayed   and then people saw everything perverted  or only had an eye for that  which was evil. this happened because the very smallest bit had the  same power which the whole mirror had possessed. some persons even got  a splinter in their heart  and then it made one shudder  for their heart  became like a lump of ice. some of the broken pieces were so large that  they were used for windowpanes  through which one could not see one's  friends. other pieces were put in spectacles  and that was a sad affair  when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. then the  wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked  for all this tickled his  fancy. the fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall  hear what happened next.      second story. a little boy and a little girl    in a large town  where there are so many houses  and so many people   that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden  and  where  on this account  most persons are obliged to content themselves  with flowers in pots  there lived two little children  who had a garden  somewhat larger than a flower-pot. they were not brother and sister  but  they cared for each other as much as if they were. their parents lived  exactly opposite. they inhabited two garrets  and where the roof of the  one house joined that of the other  and the gutter ran along the extreme  end of it  there was to each house a small window: one needed only to  step over the gutter to get from one window to the other.    the children's parents had large wooden boxes there  in which vegetables  for the kitchen were planted  and little rosetrees besides: there was a  rose in each box  and they grew splendidly. they now thought of placing  the boxes across the gutter  so that they nearly reached from one window  to the other  and looked just like two walls of flowers. the tendrils  of the peas hung down over the boxes  and the rose-trees shot up long  branches  twined round the windows  and then bent towards each other: it  was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. the boxes were  very high  and the children knew that they must not creep over them  so  they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other   and to sit on their little stools among the roses  where they could play  delightfully. in winter there was an end of this pleasure. the windows  were often frozen over  but then they heated copper farthings on the  stove  and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane  and then they had a  capital peep-hole  quite nicely rounded  and out of each peeped a gentle  friendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking  out. his name was kay  hers was gerda. in summer  with one jump  they  could get to each other  but in winter they were obliged first to  go down the long stairs  and then up the long stairs again: and  out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.    “it is the white bees that are swarming ” said kay's old grandmother.    “do the white bees choose a queen?” asked the little boy  for he knew  that the honey-bees always have one.    “yes ” said the grandmother  “she flies where the swarm hangs in the  thickest clusters. she is the largest of all  and she can never remain  quietly on the earth  but goes up again into the black clouds. many a  winter's night she flies through the streets of the town  and peeps in  at the windows  and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they  look like flowers.”    “yes  i have seen it ” said both the children  and so they knew that it  was true.    “can the snow queen come in?” said the little girl.    “only let her come in!” said the little boy. “then i'd put her on the  stove  and she'd melt.”    and then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.    in the evening  when little kay was at home  and half undressed  he  climbed up on the chair by the window  and peeped out of the little  hole. a few snow-flakes were falling  and one  the largest of all   remained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.    the flake of snow grew larger and larger  and at last it was like a  young lady  dressed in the finest white gauze  made of a million little  flakes like stars. she was so beautiful and delicate  but she was of  ice  of dazzling  sparkling ice  yet she lived  her eyes gazed fixedly   like two stars  but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. she  nodded towards the window  and beckoned with her hand. the little boy  was frightened  and jumped down from the chair  it seemed to him as if   at the same moment  a large bird flew past the window.    the next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came  the sun  shone  the green leaves appeared  the swallows built their nests  the  windows were opened  and the little children again sat in their pretty  garden  high up on the leads at the top of the house.    that summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. the little girl had  learned a hymn  in which there was something about roses  and then she  thought of her own flowers  and she sang the verse to the little boy   who then sang it with her:         “the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet        and angels descend there the children to greet.”    and the children held each other by the hand  kissed the roses  looked  up at the clear sunshine  and spoke as though they really saw angels  there. what lovely summer-days those were! how delightful to be out in  the air  near the fresh rose-bushes  that seem as if they would never  finish blossoming!    kay and gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds   and it was then--the clock in the church-tower was just striking  five--that kay said  “oh! i feel such a sharp pain in my heart  and now  something has got into my eye!”    the little girl put her arms around his neck. he winked his eyes  now  there was nothing to be seen.    “i think it is out now ” said he  but it was not. it was just one of  those pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye   and poor kay had got another piece right in his heart. it will soon  become like ice. it did not hurt any longer  but there it was.    “what are you crying for?” asked he. “you look so ugly! there's nothing  the matter with me. ah ” said he at once  “that rose is cankered! and  look  this one is quite crooked! after all  these roses are very ugly!  they are just like the box they are planted in!” and then he gave the  box a good kick with his foot  and pulled both the roses up.    “what are you doing?” cried the little girl  and as he perceived her  fright  he pulled up another rose  got in at the window  and hastened  off from dear little gerda.    afterwards  when she brought her picture-book  he asked  “what horrid  beasts have you there?” and if his grandmother told them stories  he  always interrupted her  besides  if he could manage it  he would get  behind her  put on her spectacles  and imitate her way of speaking  he  copied all her ways  and then everybody laughed at him. he was soon able  to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. everything  that was peculiar and displeasing in them--that kay knew how to imitate:  and at such times all the people said  “the boy is certainly very  clever!” but it was the glass he had got in his eye  the glass that was  sticking in his heart  which made him tease even little gerda  whose  whole soul was devoted to him.    his games now were quite different to what they had formerly been  they  were so very knowing. one winter's day  when the flakes of snow were  flying about  he spread the skirts of his blue coat  and caught the snow  as it fell.    “look through this glass  gerda ” said he. and every flake seemed  larger  and appeared like a magnificent flower  or beautiful star  it  was splendid to look at!    “look  how clever!” said kay. “that's much more interesting than real  flowers! they are as exact as possible  there is not a fault in them  if  they did not melt!”    it was not long after this  that kay came one day with large gloves on   and his little sledge at his back  and bawled right into gerda's ears   “i have permission to go out into the square where the others are  playing”  and off he was in a moment.    there  in the market-place  some of the boldest of the boys used to tie  their sledges to the carts as they passed by  and so they were pulled  along  and got a good ride. it was so capital! just as they were in the  very height of their amusement  a large sledge passed by: it was painted  quite white  and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white  mantle of fur  with a rough white fur cap on his head. the sledge drove  round the square twice  and kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he  could  and off he drove with it. on they went quicker and quicker into  the next street  and the person who drove turned round to kay  and  nodded to him in a friendly manner  just as if they knew each other.  every time he was going to untie his sledge  the person nodded to him   and then kay sat quiet  and so on they went till they came outside  the gates of the town. then the snow began to fall so thickly that the  little boy could not see an arm's length before him  but still on he  went: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order  to get loose from the sledge  but it was of no use  still the little  vehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. he then cried as loud  as he could  but no one heard him  the snow drifted and the sledge flew  on  and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges  and ditches. he was quite frightened  and he tried to repeat the  lord's prayer  but all he could do  he was only able to remember the  multiplication table.    the snow-flakes grew larger and larger  till at last they looked just  like great white fowls. suddenly they flew on one side  the large sledge  stopped  and the person who drove rose up. it was a lady  her cloak and  cap were of snow. she was tall and of slender figure  and of a dazzling  whiteness. it was the snow queen.    “we have travelled fast ” said she  “but it is freezingly cold. come  under my bearskin.” and she put him in the sledge beside her   wrapped the fur round him  and he felt as though he were sinking in a  snow-wreath.    “are you still cold?” asked she  and then she kissed his forehead.  ah! it was colder than ice  it penetrated to his very heart  which was  already almost a frozen lump  it seemed to him as if he were about to  die--but a moment more and it was quite congenial to him  and he did not  remark the cold that was around him.    “my sledge! do not forget my sledge!” it was the first thing he thought  of. it was there tied to one of the white chickens  who flew along with  it on his back behind the large sledge. the snow queen kissed kay once  more  and then he forgot little gerda  grandmother  and all whom he had  left at his home.    “now you will have no more kisses ” said she  “or else i should kiss you  to death!”    kay looked at her. she was very beautiful  a more clever  or a more  lovely countenance he could not fancy to himself  and she no longer  appeared of ice as before  when she sat outside the window  and beckoned  to him  in his eyes she was perfect  he did not fear her at all  and  told her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions  even   that he knew the number of square miles there were in the different  countries  and how many inhabitants they contained  and she smiled while  he spoke. it then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough  and  he looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him  and on she  flew with him  flew high over the black clouds  while the storm moaned  and whistled as though it were singing some old tune. on they flew  over woods and lakes  over seas  and many lands  and beneath them the  chilling storm rushed fast  the wolves howled  the snow crackled  above  them flew large screaming crows  but higher up appeared the moon  quite  large and bright  and it was on it that kay gazed during the long long  winter's night  while by day he slept at the feet of the snow queen.      third story. of the flower-garden at the old woman's who understood  witchcraft    but what became of little gerda when kay did not return? where could he  be? nobody knew  nobody could give any intelligence. all the boys knew  was  that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid  one  which drove down the street and out of the town. nobody knew  where he was  many sad tears were shed  and little gerda wept long and  bitterly  at last she said he must be dead  that he had been drowned in  the river which flowed close to the town. oh! those were very long and  dismal winter evenings!    at last spring came  with its warm sunshine.    “kay is dead and gone!” said little gerda.    “that i don't believe ” said the sunshine.    “kay is dead and gone!” said she to the swallows.    “that i don't believe ” said they: and at last little gerda did not  think so any longer either.    “i'll put on my red shoes ” said she  one morning  “kay has never seen  them  and then i'll go down to the river and ask there.”    it was quite early  she kissed her old grandmother  who was still  asleep  put on her red shoes  and went alone to the river.    “is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? i will make you a  present of my red shoes  if you will give him back to me.”    and  as it seemed to her  the blue waves nodded in a strange manner   then she took off her red shoes  the most precious things she possessed   and threw them both into the river. but they fell close to the bank  and  the little waves bore them immediately to land  it was as if the stream  would not take what was dearest to her  for in reality it had not got  little kay  but gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far  enough  so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes  went  to the farthest end  and threw out the shoes. but the boat was not  fastened  and the motion which she occasioned  made it drift from the  shore. she observed this  and hastened to get back  but before she could  do so  the boat was more than a yard from the land  and was gliding  quickly onward.    little gerda was very frightened  and began to cry  but no one heard her  except the sparrows  and they could not carry her to land  but they flew  along the bank  and sang as if to comfort her  “here we are! here we  are!” the boat drifted with the stream  little gerda sat quite still  without shoes  for they were swimming behind the boat  but she could not  reach them  because the boat went much faster than they did.    the banks on both sides were beautiful  lovely flowers  venerable trees   and slopes with sheep and cows  but not a human being was to be seen.    “perhaps the river will carry me to little kay ” said she  and then  she grew less sad. she rose  and looked for many hours at the beautiful  green banks. presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard  where was  a little cottage with curious red and blue windows  it was thatched   and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry  and presented arms when  anyone went past.    gerda called to them  for she thought they were alive  but they  of  course  did not answer. she came close to them  for the stream drifted  the boat quite near the land.    gerda called still louder  and an old woman then came out of the  cottage  leaning upon a crooked stick. she had a large broad-brimmed hat  on  painted with the most splendid flowers.    “poor little child!” said the old woman. “how did you get upon the large  rapid river  to be driven about so in the wide world!” and then the  old woman went into the water  caught hold of the boat with her crooked  stick  drew it to the bank  and lifted little gerda out.    and gerda was so glad to be on dry land again  but she was rather afraid  of the strange old woman.    “but come and tell me who you are  and how you came here ” said she.    and gerda told her all  and the old woman shook her head and said   “a-hem! a-hem!” and when gerda had told her everything  and asked her if  she had not seen little kay  the woman answered that he had not passed  there  but he no doubt would come  and she told her not to be cast down   but taste her cherries  and look at her flowers  which were finer than  any in a picture-book  each of which could tell a whole story. she then  took gerda by the hand  led her into the little cottage  and locked the  door.    the windows were very high up  the glass was red  blue  and green  and  the sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. on  the table stood the most exquisite cherries  and gerda ate as many as  she chose  for she had permission to do so. while she was eating  the  old woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and  shone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face  which  was so round and so like a rose.    “i have often longed for such a dear little girl ” said the old woman.  “now you shall see how well we agree together”  and while she combed  little gerda's hair  the child forgot her foster-brother kay more and  more  for the old woman understood magic  but she was no evil being  she  only practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement  and  now she wanted very much to keep little gerda. she therefore went out  in the garden  stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes   which  beautifully as they were blowing  all sank into the earth and no  one could tell where they had stood. the old woman feared that if gerda  should see the roses  she would then think of her own  would remember  little kay  and run away from her.    she now led gerda into the flower-garden. oh  what odour and what  loveliness was there! every flower that one could think of  and of every  season  stood there in fullest bloom  no picture-book could be gayer or  more beautiful. gerda jumped for joy  and played till the sun set behind  the tall cherry-tree  she then had a pretty bed  with a red silken  coverlet filled with blue violets. she fell asleep  and had as pleasant  dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.    the next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine   and thus passed away a day. gerda knew every flower  and  numerous as  they were  it still seemed to gerda that one was wanting  though she  did not know which. one day while she was looking at the hat of the old  woman painted with flowers  the most beautiful of them all seemed to her  to be a rose. the old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat  when she made the others vanish in the earth. but so it is when one's  thoughts are not collected. “what!” said gerda. “are there no roses  here?” and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds  and looked  and looked   but there was not one to be found. she then sat down and wept  but her  hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk  and when her warm tears  watered the ground  the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as  when it had been swallowed up. gerda kissed the roses  thought of her  own dear roses at home  and with them of little kay.    “oh  how long i have stayed!” said the little girl. “i intended to look  for kay! don't you know where he is?” she asked of the roses. “do you  think he is dead and gone?”    “dead he certainly is not ” said the roses. “we have been in the earth  where all the dead are  but kay was not there.”    “many thanks!” said little gerda  and she went to the other flowers   looked into their cups  and asked  “don't you know where little kay is?”    but every flower stood in the sunshine  and dreamed its own fairy tale  or its own story: and they all told her very many things  but not one  knew anything of kay.    well  what did the tiger-lily say?    “hearest thou not the drum? bum! bum! those are the only two tones.  always bum! bum! hark to the plaintive song of the old woman  to the  call of the priests! the hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the  funeral pile  the flames rise around her and her dead husband  but the  hindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle  on him  whose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him  the fire of whose eyes  pierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to  ashes. can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?”    “i don't understand that at all ” said little gerda.    “that is my story ” said the lily.    what did the convolvulus say?    “projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal  castle. thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls  and around the  altar  where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and  looks out upon the rose. no fresher rose hangs on the branches than she   no appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! how her silken  robe is rustling!    “'is he not yet come?'”    “is it kay that you mean?” asked little gerda.    “i am speaking about my story--about my dream ” answered the  convolvulus.    what did the snowdrops say?    “between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. two little  girls are sitting in it  and swing themselves backwards and forwards   their frocks are as white as snow  and long green silk ribands flutter  from their bonnets. their brother  who is older than they are  stands up  in the swing  he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast   for in one hand he has a little cup  and in the other a clay-pipe. he is  blowing soap-bubbles. the swing moves  and the bubbles float in charming  changing colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe  and  rocks in the breeze. the swing moves. the little black dog  as light as  a soap-bubble  jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing.  it moves  the dog falls down  barks  and is angry. they tease him  the  bubble bursts! a swing  a bursting bubble--such is my song!”    “what you relate may be very pretty  but you tell it in so melancholy a  manner  and do not mention kay.”    what do the hyacinths say?    “there were once upon a time three sisters  quite transparent  and very  beautiful. the robe of the one was red  that of the second blue  and  that of the third white. they danced hand in hand beside the calm  lake in the clear moonshine. they were not elfin maidens  but mortal  children. a sweet fragrance was smelt  and the maidens vanished in the  wood  the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins  and in them three  lovely maidens  glided out of the forest and across the lake: the  shining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. do the  dancing maidens sleep  or are they dead? the odour of the flowers says  they are corpses  the evening bell tolls for the dead!”    “you make me quite sad ” said little gerda. “i cannot help thinking of  the dead maidens. oh! is little kay really dead? the roses have been in  the earth  and they say no.”    “ding  dong!” sounded the hyacinth bells. “we do not toll for little  kay  we do not know him. that is our way of singing  the only one we  have.”    and gerda went to the ranunculuses  that looked forth from among the  shining green leaves.    “you are a little bright sun!” said gerda. “tell me if you know where i  can find my playfellow.”    and the ranunculus shone brightly  and looked again at gerda. what  song could the ranunculus sing? it was one that said nothing about kay  either.    “in a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of  spring. the beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house  and  close by the fresh yellow flowers were growing  shining like gold in  the warm sun-rays. an old grandmother was sitting in the air  her  grand-daughter  the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit.  she knows her grandmother. there was gold  pure virgin gold in that  blessed kiss. there  that is my little story ” said the ranunculus.    “my poor old grandmother!” sighed gerda. “yes  she is longing for me   no doubt: she is sorrowing for me  as she did for little kay. but i  will soon come home  and then i will bring kay with me. it is of no use  asking the flowers  they only know their own old rhymes  and can tell me  nothing.” and she tucked up her frock  to enable her to run quicker  but  the narcissus gave her a knock on the leg  just as she was going to  jump over it. so she stood still  looked at the long yellow flower  and  asked  “you perhaps know something?” and she bent down to the narcissus.  and what did it say?    “i can see myself--i can see myself! oh  how odorous i am! up in the  little garret there stands  half-dressed  a little dancer. she stands  now on one leg  now on both  she despises the whole world  yet she lives  only in imagination. she pours water out of the teapot over a piece of  stuff which she holds in her hand  it is the bodice  cleanliness is a  fine thing. the white dress is hanging on the hook  it was washed in the  teapot  and dried on the roof. she puts it on  ties a saffron-colored  kerchief round her neck  and then the gown looks whiter. i can see  myself--i can see myself!”    “that's nothing to me ” said little gerda. “that does not concern me.”   and then off she ran to the further end of the garden.    the gate was locked  but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened   and the gate opened  and little gerda ran off barefooted into the wide  world. she looked round her thrice  but no one followed her. at last she  could run no longer  she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked  about her  she saw that the summer had passed  it was late in the  autumn  but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden  where  there was always sunshine  and where there were flowers the whole year  round.    “dear me  how long i have staid!” said gerda. “autumn is come. i must  not rest any longer.” and she got up to go further.    oh  how tender and wearied her little feet were! all around it looked  so cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow  and the fog  dripped from them like water  one leaf fell after the other: the sloes  only stood full of fruit  which set one's teeth on edge. oh  how dark  and comfortless it was in the dreary world!      fourth story. the prince and princess    gerda was obliged to rest herself again  when  exactly opposite to her   a large raven came hopping over the white snow. he had long been looking  at gerda and shaking his head  and now he said  “caw! caw!” good day!  good day! he could not say it better  but he felt a sympathy for the  little girl  and asked her where she was going all alone. the word  “alone” gerda understood quite well  and felt how much was expressed  by it  so she told the raven her whole history  and asked if he had not  seen kay.    the raven nodded very gravely  and said  “it may be--it may be!”    “what  do you really think so?” cried the little girl  and she nearly  squeezed the raven to death  so much did she kiss him.    “gently  gently ” said the raven. “i think i know  i think that it may  be little kay. but now he has forgotten you for the princess.”    “does he live with a princess?” asked gerda.    “yes--listen ” said the raven  “but it will be difficult for me to  speak your language. if you understand the raven language i can tell you  better.”    “no  i have not learnt it ” said gerda  “but my grandmother understands  it  and she can speak gibberish too. i wish i had learnt it.”    “no matter ” said the raven  “i will tell you as well as i can  however   it will be bad enough.” and then he told all he knew.    “in the kingdom where we now are there lives a princess  who is  extraordinarily clever  for she has read all the newspapers in the whole  world  and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. she was lately   it is said  sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after  all--when she began humming an old tune  and it was just  'oh  why  should i not be married?' 'that song is not without its meaning ' said  she  and so then she was determined to marry  but she would have a  husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not  one who looked only as if he were a great personage  for that is so  tiresome. she then had all the ladies of the court drummed together  and  when they heard her intention  all were very pleased  and said  'we are  very glad to hear it  it is the very thing we were thinking of.' you may  believe every word i say ” said the raven  “for i have a tame sweetheart  that hops about in the palace quite free  and it was she who told me all  this.    “the newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the  initials of the princess  and therein you might read that every  good-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to  the princess  and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at  home there  that one the princess would choose for her husband.    “yes  yes ” said the raven  “you may believe it  it is as true as i am  sitting here. people came in crowds  there was a crush and a hurry  but  no one was successful either on the first or second day. they could all  talk well enough when they were out in the street  but as soon as  they came inside the palace gates  and saw the guard richly dressed  in silver  and the lackeys in gold on the staircase  and the large  illuminated saloons  then they were abashed  and when they stood before  the throne on which the princess was sitting  all they could do was  to repeat the last word they had uttered  and to hear it again did not  interest her very much. it was just as if the people within were under  a charm  and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the  street  for then--oh  then--they could chatter enough. there was a whole  row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. i was there  myself to look ” said the raven. “they grew hungry and thirsty  but from  the palace they got nothing whatever  not even a glass of water. some  of the cleverest  it is true  had taken bread and butter with them:  but none shared it with his neighbor  for each thought  'let him look  hungry  and then the princess won't have him.'”    “but kay--little kay ” said gerda  “when did he come? was he among the  number?”    “patience  patience  we are just come to him. it was on the third day  when a little personage without horse or equipage  came marching right  boldly up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had beautiful  long hair  but his clothes were very shabby.”    “that was kay ” cried gerda  with a voice of delight. “oh  now i've  found him!” and she clapped her hands for joy.    “he had a little knapsack at his back ” said the raven.    “no  that was certainly his sledge ” said gerda  “for when he went away  he took his sledge with him.”    “that may be ” said the raven  “i did not examine him so minutely  but  i know from my tame sweetheart  that when he came into the court-yard  of the palace  and saw the body-guard in silver  the lackeys on the  staircase  he was not the least abashed  he nodded  and said to them   'it must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs  for my part  i shall  go in.' the saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and  excellencies were walking about barefooted  and wore gold keys  it was  enough to make any one feel uncomfortable. his boots creaked  too  so  loudly  but still he was not at all afraid.”    “that's kay for certain ” said gerda. “i know he had on new boots  i  have heard them creaking in grandmama's room.”    “yes  they creaked ” said the raven. “and on he went boldly up to the  princess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.  all the ladies of the court  with their attendants and attendants'  attendants  and all the cavaliers  with their gentlemen and gentlemen's  gentlemen  stood round  and the nearer they stood to the door  the  prouder they looked. it was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's  gentleman  so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway.”    “it must have been terrible ” said little gerda. “and did kay get the  princess?”    “were i not a raven  i should have taken the princess myself  although  i am promised. it is said he spoke as well as i speak when i talk raven  language  this i learned from my tame sweetheart. he was bold and nicely  behaved  he had not come to woo the princess  but only to hear her  wisdom. she pleased him  and he pleased her.”    “yes  yes  for certain that was kay ” said gerda. “he was so clever   he could reckon fractions in his head. oh  won't you take me to the  palace?”    “that is very easily said ” answered the raven. “but how are we to  manage it? i'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise  us  for so much i must tell you  such a little girl as you are will  never get permission to enter.”    “oh  yes i shall ” said gerda  “when kay hears that i am here  he will  come out directly to fetch me.”    “wait for me here on these steps ” said the raven. he moved his head  backwards and forwards and flew away.    the evening was closing in when the raven returned. “caw--caw!” said he.  “she sends you her compliments  and here is a roll for you. she took  it out of the kitchen  where there is bread enough. you are hungry   no doubt. it is not possible for you to enter the palace  for you are  barefooted: the guards in silver  and the lackeys in gold  would not  allow it  but do not cry  you shall come in still. my sweetheart knows a  little back stair that leads to the bedchamber  and she knows where she  can get the key of it.”    and they went into the garden in the large avenue  where one leaf was  falling after the other  and when the lights in the palace had all  gradually disappeared  the raven led little gerda to the back door   which stood half open.    oh  how gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! it was just as if  she had been about to do something wrong  and yet she only wanted to  know if little kay was there. yes  he must be there. she called to mind  his intelligent eyes  and his long hair  so vividly  she could quite see  him as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home.  “he will  no doubt  be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have  come for his sake  to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not  come back.”    oh  what a fright and a joy it was!    they were now on the stairs. a single lamp was burning there  and on the  floor stood the tame raven  turning her head on every side and looking  at gerda  who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.    “my intended has told me so much good of you  my dear young lady ” said  the tame raven. “your tale is very affecting. if you will take the lamp   i will go before. we will go straight on  for we shall meet no one.”    “i think there is somebody just behind us ” said gerda  and something  rushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall  horses with  flowing manes and thin legs  huntsmen  ladies and gentlemen on  horseback.    “they are only dreams ” said the raven. “they come to fetch the thoughts  of the high personages to the chase  'tis well  for now you can observe  them in bed all the better. but let me find  when you enjoy honor and  distinction  that you possess a grateful heart.”    “tut! that's not worth talking about ” said the raven of the woods.    they now entered the first saloon  which was of rose-colored satin  with  artificial flowers on the wall. here the dreams were rushing past   but they hastened by so quickly that gerda could not see the high  personages. one hall was more magnificent than the other  one might  indeed well be abashed  and at last they came into the bedchamber. the  ceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass   of costly glass  and in the middle  from a thick golden stem  hung two  beds  each of which resembled a lily. one was white  and in this lay the  princess  the other was red  and it was here that gerda was to look for  little kay. she bent back one of the red leaves  and saw a brown neck.  oh! that was kay! she called him quite loud by name  held the lamp  towards him--the dreams rushed back again into the chamber--he awoke   turned his head  and--it was not little kay!    the prince was only like him about the neck  but he was young and  handsome. and out of the white lily leaves the princess peeped  too   and asked what was the matter. then little gerda cried  and told her her  whole history  and all that the ravens had done for her.    “poor little thing!” said the prince and the princess. they praised the  ravens very much  and told them they were not at all angry with them   but they were not to do so again. however  they should have a reward.  “will you fly about here at liberty ” asked the princess  “or would you  like to have a fixed appointment as court ravens  with all the broken  bits from the kitchen?”    and both the ravens nodded  and begged for a fixed appointment  for  they thought of their old age  and said  “it is a good thing to have a  provision for our old days.”    and the prince got up and let gerda sleep in his bed  and more than this  he could not do. she folded her little hands and thought  “how good men  and animals are!” and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. all the  dreams flew in again  and they now looked like the angels  they drew  a little sledge  in which little kay sat and nodded his head  but the  whole was only a dream  and therefore it all vanished as soon as she  awoke.    the next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. they  offered to let her stay at the palace  and lead a happy life  but she  begged to have a little carriage with a horse in front  and for a small  pair of shoes  then  she said  she would again go forth in the wide  world and look for kay.    shoes and a muff were given her  she was  too  dressed very nicely  and  when she was about to set off  a new carriage stopped before the door.  it was of pure gold  and the arms of the prince and princess shone  like a star upon it  the coachman  the footmen  and the outriders  for  outriders were there  too  all wore golden crowns. the prince and the  princess assisted her into the carriage themselves  and wished her all  success. the raven of the woods  who was now married  accompanied her  for the first three miles. he sat beside gerda  for he could not bear  riding backwards  the other raven stood in the doorway  and flapped her  wings  she could not accompany gerda  because she suffered from headache  since she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. the carriage  was lined inside with sugar-plums  and in the seats were fruits and  gingerbread.    “farewell! farewell!” cried prince and princess  and gerda wept  and  the raven wept. thus passed the first miles  and then the raven bade her  farewell  and this was the most painful separation of all. he flew into  a tree  and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage   that shone from afar like a sunbeam.      fifth story. the little robber maiden    they drove through the dark wood  but the carriage shone like a torch   and it dazzled the eyes of the robbers  so that they could not bear to  look at it.    “'tis gold! 'tis gold!” they cried  and they rushed forward  seized  the horses  knocked down the little postilion  the coachman  and the  servants  and pulled little gerda out of the carriage.    “how plump  how beautiful she is! she must have been fed on  nut-kernels ” said the old female robber  who had a long  scrubby beard   and bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. “she is as good as a  fatted lamb! how nice she will be!” and then she drew out a knife  the  blade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.    “oh!” cried the woman at the same moment. she had been bitten in the ear  by her own little daughter  who hung at her back  and who was so wild  and unmanageable  that it was quite amusing to see her. “you naughty  child!” said the mother: and now she had not time to kill gerda.    “she shall play with me ” said the little robber child. “she shall give  me her muff  and her pretty frock  she shall sleep in my bed!” and then  she gave her mother another bite  so that she jumped  and ran round with  the pain  and the robbers laughed  and said  “look  how she is dancing  with the little one!”    “i will go into the carriage ” said the little robber maiden  and she  would have her will  for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. she  and gerda got in  and then away they drove over the stumps of felled  trees  deeper and deeper into the woods. the little robber maiden was as  tall as gerda  but stronger  broader-shouldered  and of dark complexion   her eyes were quite black  they looked almost melancholy. she embraced  little gerda  and said  “they shall not kill you as long as i am not  displeased with you. you are  doubtless  a princess?”    “no ” said little gerda  who then related all that had happened to her   and how much she cared about little kay.    the little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air  nodded her  head slightly  and said  “they shall not kill you  even if i am angry  with you: then i will do it myself”  and she dried gerda's eyes  and put  both her hands in the handsome muff  which was so soft and warm.    at length the carriage stopped. they were in the midst of the court-yard  of a robber's castle. it was full of cracks from top to bottom  and out  of the openings magpies and rooks were flying  and the great bull-dogs   each of which looked as if he could swallow a man  jumped up  but they  did not bark  for that was forbidden.    in the midst of the large  old  smoking hall burnt a great fire on the  stone floor. the smoke disappeared under the stones  and had to seek  its own egress. in an immense caldron soup was boiling  and rabbits and  hares were being roasted on a spit.    “you shall sleep with me to-night  with all my animals ” said the little  robber maiden. they had something to eat and drink  and then went into  a corner  where straw and carpets were lying. beside them  on laths and  perches  sat nearly a hundred pigeons  all asleep  seemingly  but yet  they moved a little when the robber maiden came. “they are all mine ”   said she  at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs  and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. “kiss it ” cried the little  girl  and flung the pigeon in gerda's face. “up there is the rabble of  the wood ” continued she  pointing to several laths which were fastened  before a hole high up in the wall  “that's the rabble  they would all  fly away immediately  if they were not well fastened in. and here is my  dear old bac”  and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer  that had a  bright copper ring round its neck  and was tethered to the spot. “we are  obliged to lock this fellow in too  or he would make his escape. every  evening i tickle his neck with my sharp knife  he is so frightened at  it!” and the little girl drew forth a long knife  from a crack in the  wall  and let it glide over the reindeer's neck. the poor animal kicked   the girl laughed  and pulled gerda into bed with her.    “do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?” asked gerda  looking  at it rather fearfully.    “i always sleep with the knife ” said the little robber maiden. “there  is no knowing what may happen. but tell me now  once more  all about  little kay  and why you have started off in the wide world alone.” and  gerda related all  from the very beginning: the wood-pigeons cooed above  in their cage  and the others slept. the little robber maiden wound her  arm round gerda's neck  held the knife in the other hand  and snored so  loud that everybody could hear her  but gerda could not close her eyes   for she did not know whether she was to live or die. the robbers sat  round the fire  sang and drank  and the old female robber jumped about  so  that it was quite dreadful for gerda to see her.    then the wood-pigeons said  “coo! coo! we have seen little kay! a white  hen carries his sledge  he himself sat in the carriage of the snow  queen  who passed here  down just over the wood  as we lay in our nest.  she blew upon us young ones  and all died except we two. coo! coo!”    “what is that you say up there?” cried little gerda. “where did the snow  queen go to? do you know anything about it?”    “she is no doubt gone to lapland  for there is always snow and ice  there. only ask the reindeer  who is tethered there.”    “ice and snow is there! there it is  glorious and beautiful!” said the  reindeer. “one can spring about in the large shining valleys! the snow  queen has her summer-tent there  but her fixed abode is high up towards  the north pole  on the island called spitzbergen.”    “oh  kay! poor little kay!” sighed gerda.    “do you choose to be quiet?” said the robber maiden. “if you don't  i  shall make you.”    in the morning gerda told her all that the wood-pigeons had said  and  the little maiden looked very serious  but she nodded her head  and  said  “that's no matter--that's no matter. do you know where lapland  lies!” she asked of the reindeer.    “who should know better than i?” said the animal  and his eyes rolled in  his head. “i was born and bred there--there i leapt about on the fields  of snow.”    “listen ” said the robber maiden to gerda. “you see that the men are  gone  but my mother is still here  and will remain. however  towards  morning she takes a draught out of the large flask  and then she sleeps  a little: then i will do something for you.” she now jumped out of bed   flew to her mother  with her arms round her neck  and pulling her by the  beard  said  “good morrow  my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.” and her  mother took hold of her nose  and pinched it till it was red and blue   but this was all done out of pure love.    when the mother had taken a sup at her flask  and was having a nap  the  little robber maiden went to the reindeer  and said  “i should very much  like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife  for then  you are so amusing  however  i will untether you  and help you out   so that you may go back to lapland. but you must make good use of your  legs  and take this little girl for me to the palace of the snow queen   where her playfellow is. you have heard  i suppose  all she said  for  she spoke loud enough  and you were listening.”    the reindeer gave a bound for joy. the robber maiden lifted up little  gerda  and took the precaution to bind her fast on the reindeer's back   she even gave her a small cushion to sit on. “here are your worsted  leggins  for it will be cold  but the muff i shall keep for myself  for  it is so very pretty. but i do not wish you to be cold. here is a pair  of lined gloves of my mother's  they just reach up to your elbow. on  with them! now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!”    and gerda wept for joy.    “i can't bear to see you fretting ” said the little robber maiden. “this  is just the time when you ought to look pleased. here are two loaves and  a ham for you  so that you won't starve.” the bread and the meat were  fastened to the reindeer's back  the little maiden opened the door   called in all the dogs  and then with her knife cut the rope that  fastened the animal  and said to him  “now  off with you  but take good  care of the little girl!”    and gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards  the robber maiden  and said  “farewell!” and the reindeer flew on over  bush and bramble through the great wood  over moor and heath  as fast as  he could go.    “ddsa! ddsa!” was heard in the sky. it was just as if somebody was  sneezing.    “these are my old northern-lights ” said the reindeer  “look how they  gleam!” and on he now sped still quicker--day and night on he went: the  loaves were consumed  and the ham too  and now they were in lapland.      sixth story. the lapland woman and the finland woman    suddenly they stopped before a little house  which looked very  miserable. the roof reached to the ground  and the door was so low  that  the family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in  or out. nobody was at home except an old lapland woman  who was dressing  fish by the light of an oil lamp. and the reindeer told her the whole  of gerda's history  but first of all his own  for that seemed to him of  much greater importance. gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.    “poor thing ” said the lapland woman  “you have far to run still. you  have more than a hundred miles to go before you get to finland  there  the snow queen has her country-house  and burns blue lights every  evening. i will give you a few words from me  which i will write on a  dried haberdine  for paper i have none  this you can take with you to  the finland woman  and she will be able to give you more information  than i can.”    when gerda had warmed herself  and had eaten and drunk  the lapland  woman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine  begged gerda to take care  of them  put her on the reindeer  bound her fast  and away sprang the  animal. “ddsa! ddsa!” was again heard in the air  the most charming  blue lights burned the whole night in the sky  and at last they came to  finland. they knocked at the chimney of the finland woman  for as to a  door  she had none.    there was such a heat inside that the finland woman herself went about  almost naked. she was diminutive and dirty. she immediately loosened  little gerda's clothes  pulled off her thick gloves and boots  for  otherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece  of ice on the reindeer's head  read what was written on the fish-skin.  she read it three times: she then knew it by heart  so she put the fish  into the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten  and she never threw  anything away.    then the reindeer related his own story first  and afterwards that of  little gerda  and the finland woman winked her eyes  but said nothing.    “you are so clever ” said the reindeer  “you can  i know  twist all the  winds of the world together in a knot. if the seaman loosens one knot   then he has a good wind  if a second  then it blows pretty stiffly  if  he undoes the third and fourth  then it rages so that the forests are  upturned. will you give the little maiden a potion  that she may possess  the strength of twelve men  and vanquish the snow queen?”    “the strength of twelve men!” said the finland woman. “much good that  would be!” then she went to a cupboard  and drew out a large skin rolled  up. when she had unrolled it  strange characters were to be seen written  thereon  and the finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration  trickled down her forehead.    but the reindeer begged so hard for little gerda  and gerda looked so  imploringly with tearful eyes at the finland woman  that she winked  and  drew the reindeer aside into a corner  where they whispered together   while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.    “'tis true little kay is at the snow queen's  and finds everything there  quite to his taste  and he thinks it the very best place in the world   but the reason of that is  he has a splinter of glass in his eye  and in  his heart. these must be got out first  otherwise he will never go back  to mankind  and the snow queen will retain her power over him.”    “but can you give little gerda nothing to take which will endue her with  power over the whole?”    “i can give her no more power than what she has already. don't you see  how great it is? don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve  her  how well she gets through the world barefooted? she must not hear  of her power from us  that power lies in her heart  because she is  a sweet and innocent child! if she cannot get to the snow queen by  herself  and rid little kay of the glass  we cannot help her. two miles  hence the garden of the snow queen begins  thither you may carry the  little girl. set her down by the large bush with red berries  standing  in the snow  don't stay talking  but hasten back as fast as possible.”   and now the finland woman placed little gerda on the reindeer's back   and off he ran with all imaginable speed.    “oh! i have not got my boots! i have not brought my gloves!” cried  little gerda. she remarked she was without them from the cutting frost   but the reindeer dared not stand still  on he ran till he came to the  great bush with the red berries  and there he set gerda down  kissed her  mouth  while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes  and then  back he went as fast as possible. there stood poor gerda now  without  shoes or gloves  in the very middle of dreadful icy finland.    she ran on as fast as she could. there then came a whole regiment of  snow-flakes  but they did not fall from above  and they were quite  bright and shining from the aurora borealis. the flakes ran along  the ground  and the nearer they came the larger they grew. gerda well  remembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she  once saw them through a magnifying-glass  but now they were large and  terrific in another manner--they were all alive. they were the outposts  of the snow queen. they had the most wondrous shapes  some looked like  large ugly porcupines  others like snakes knotted together  with their  heads sticking out  and others  again  like small fat bears  with the  hair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness--all were living  snow-flakes.    little gerda repeated the lord's prayer. the cold was so intense that  she could see her own breath  which came like smoke out of her mouth. it  grew thicker and thicker  and took the form of little angels  that grew  more and more when they touched the earth. all had helms on their heads   and lances and shields in their hands  they increased in numbers  and  when gerda had finished the lord's prayer  she was surrounded by a whole  legion. they thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears  so that  they flew into a thousand pieces  and little gerda walked on bravely and  in security. the angels patted her hands and feet  and then she felt the  cold less  and went on quickly towards the palace of the snow queen.    but now we shall see how kay fared. he never thought of gerda  and least  of all that she was standing before the palace.      seventh story. what took place in the palace of the snow queen  and what  happened afterward.    the walls of the palace were of driving snow  and the windows and doors  of cutting winds. there were more than a hundred halls there  according  as the snow was driven by the winds. the largest was many miles in  extent  all were lighted up by the powerful aurora borealis  and all  were so large  so empty  so icy cold  and so resplendent! mirth never  reigned there  there was never even a little bear-ball  with the storm  for music  while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off  their steps. never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes  vast   cold  and empty were the halls of the snow queen. the northern-lights  shone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were  at their highest or lowest degree of brightness. in the middle of the  empty  endless hall of snow  was a frozen lake  it was cracked in a  thousand pieces  but each piece was so like the other  that it seemed  the work of a cunning artificer. in the middle of this lake sat the snow  queen when she was at home  and then she said she was sitting in the  mirror of understanding  and that this was the only one and the best  thing in the world.    little kay was quite blue  yes nearly black with cold  but he did not  observe it  for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body   and his heart was a lump of ice. he was dragging along some pointed  flat pieces of ice  which he laid together in all possible ways  for he  wanted to make something with them  just as we have little flat pieces  of wood to make geometrical figures with  called the chinese puzzle.  kay made all sorts of figures  the most complicated  for it was  an ice-puzzle for the understanding. in his eyes the figures were  extraordinarily beautiful  and of the utmost importance  for the bit  of glass which was in his eye caused this. he found whole figures which  represented a written word  but he never could manage to represent just  the word he wanted--that word was “eternity”  and the snow queen had  said  “if you can discover that figure  you shall be your own master   and i will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new  skates.” but he could not find it out.    “i am going now to warm lands ” said the snow queen. “i must have a look  down into the black caldrons.” it was the volcanoes vesuvius and etna  that she meant. “i will just give them a coating of white  for that is  as it ought to be  besides  it is good for the oranges and the grapes.”   and then away she flew  and kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of  ice that were miles long  and looked at the blocks of ice  and thought  and thought till his skull was almost cracked. there he sat quite  benumbed and motionless  one would have imagined he was frozen to death.    suddenly little gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.  the gate was formed of cutting winds  but gerda repeated her evening  prayer  and the winds were laid as though they slept  and the little  maiden entered the vast  empty  cold halls. there she beheld kay: she  recognised him  flew to embrace him  and cried out  her arms firmly  holding him the while  “kay  sweet little kay! have i then found you at  last?”    but he sat quite still  benumbed and cold. then little gerda shed  burning tears  and they fell on his bosom  they penetrated to his  heart  they thawed the lumps of ice  and consumed the splinters of the  looking-glass  he looked at her  and she sang the hymn:    “the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet  and angels descend there  the children to greet.”    hereupon kay burst into tears  he wept so much that the splinter rolled  out of his eye  and he recognised her  and shouted  “gerda  sweet little  gerda! where have you been so long? and where have i been?” he looked  round him. “how cold it is here!” said he. “how empty and cold!” and he  held fast by gerda  who laughed and wept for joy. it was so beautiful   that even the blocks of ice danced about for joy  and when they were  tired and laid themselves down  they formed exactly the letters which  the snow queen had told him to find out  so now he was his own master   and he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the  bargain.    gerda kissed his cheeks  and they grew quite blooming  she kissed his  eyes  and they shone like her own  she kissed his hands and feet  and he  was again well and merry. the snow queen might come back as soon as she  liked  there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.    they took each other by the hand  and wandered forth out of the large  hall  they talked of their old grandmother  and of the roses upon the  roof  and wherever they went  the winds ceased raging  and the sun burst  forth. and when they reached the bush with the red berries  they found  the reindeer waiting for them. he had brought another  a young one  with  him  whose udder was filled with milk  which he gave to the little ones   and kissed their lips. they then carried kay and gerda--first to the  finland woman  where they warmed themselves in the warm room  and  learned what they were to do on their journey home  and they went to  the lapland woman  who made some new clothes for them and repaired their  sledges.    the reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them  and  accompanied them to the boundary of the country. here the first  vegetation peeped forth  here kay and gerda took leave of the lapland  woman. “farewell! farewell!” they all said. and the first green buds  appeared  the first little birds began to chirrup  and out of the wood  came  riding on a magnificent horse  which gerda knew (it was one of the  leaders in the golden carriage)  a young damsel with a bright-red cap on  her head  and armed with pistols. it was the little robber maiden  who   tired of being at home  had determined to make a journey to the north   and afterwards in another direction  if that did not please her. she  recognised gerda immediately  and gerda knew her too. it was a joyful  meeting.    “you are a fine fellow for tramping about ” said she to little kay  “i  should like to know  faith  if you deserve that one should run from one  end of the world to the other for your sake?”    but gerda patted her cheeks  and inquired for the prince and princess.    “they are gone abroad ” said the other.    “but the raven?” asked little gerda.    “oh! the raven is dead ” she answered. “his tame sweetheart is a  widow  and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg  she laments most  piteously  but it's all mere talk and stuff! now tell me what you've  been doing and how you managed to catch him.”    and gerda and kay both told their story.    and “schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre ” said the robber maiden  and  she took the hands of each  and promised that if she should some day  pass through the town where they lived  she would come and visit them   and then away she rode. kay and gerda took each other's hand: it was  lovely spring weather  with abundance of flowers and of verdure. the  church-bells rang  and the children recognised the high towers  and the  large town  it was that in which they dwelt. they entered and hastened  up to their grandmother's room  where everything was standing as  formerly. the clock said “tick! tack!” and the finger moved round  but  as they entered  they remarked that they were now grown up. the roses  on the leads hung blooming in at the open window  there stood the little  children's chairs  and kay and gerda sat down on them  holding each  other by the hand  they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of  the snow queen  as though it had been a dream. the grandmother sat in  the bright sunshine  and read aloud from the bible: “unless ye become as  little children  ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.”    and kay and gerda looked in each other's eyes  and all at once they  understood the old hymn:    “the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet  and angels descend there  the children to greet.”    there sat the two grown-up persons  grown-up  and yet children  children  at least in heart  and it was summer-time  summer  glorious summer!          the leap-frog    a flea  a grasshopper  and a leap-frog once wanted to see which could  jump highest  and they invited the whole world  and everybody else  besides who chose to come to see the festival. three famous jumpers were  they  as everyone would say  when they all met together in the room.    “i will give my daughter to him who jumps highest ” exclaimed the king   “for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.”    the flea was the first to step forward. he had exquisite manners  and  bowed to the company on all sides  for he had noble blood  and was   moreover  accustomed to the society of man alone  and that makes a great  difference.    then came the grasshopper. he was considerably heavier  but he was  well-mannered  and wore a green uniform  which he had by right of birth   he said  moreover  that he belonged to a very ancient egyptian family   and that in the house where he then was  he was thought much of. the  fact was  he had been just brought out of the fields  and put in a  pasteboard house  three stories high  all made of court-cards  with the  colored side inwards  and doors and windows cut out of the body of  the queen of hearts. “i sing so well ” said he  “that sixteen native  grasshoppers who have chirped from infancy  and yet got no house built  of cards to live in  grew thinner than they were before for sheer  vexation when they heard me.”    it was thus that the flea and the grasshopper gave an account of  themselves  and thought they were quite good enough to marry a princess.    the leap-frog said nothing  but people gave it as their opinion  that  he therefore thought the more  and when the housedog snuffed at him  with his nose  he confessed the leap-frog was of good family. the old  councillor  who had had three orders given him to make him hold his  tongue  asserted that the leap-frog was a prophet  for that one could  see on his back  if there would be a severe or mild winter  and that  was what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the  almanac.    “i say nothing  it is true ” exclaimed the king  “but i have my own  opinion  notwithstanding.”    now the trial was to take place. the flea jumped so high that nobody  could see where he went to  so they all asserted he had not jumped at  all  and that was dishonorable.    the grasshopper jumped only half as high  but he leaped into the king's  face  who said that was ill-mannered.    the leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought  it was  believed at last he would not jump at all.    “i only hope he is not unwell ” said the house-dog  when  pop! he made a  jump all on one side into the lap of the princess  who was sitting on a  little golden stool close by.    hereupon the king said  “there is nothing above my daughter  therefore  to bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made  but for this   one must possess understanding  and the leap-frog has shown that he has  understanding. he is brave and intellectual.”    and so he won the princess.    “it's all the same to me ” said the flea. “she may have the old  leap-frog  for all i care. i jumped the highest  but in this world  merit seldom meets its reward. a fine exterior is what people look at  now-a-days.”    the flea then went into foreign service  where  it is said  he was  killed.    the grasshopper sat without on a green bank  and reflected on worldly  things  and he said too  “yes  a fine exterior is everything--a fine  exterior is what people care about.” and then he began chirping his  peculiar melancholy song  from which we have taken this history  and  which may  very possibly  be all untrue  although it does stand here  printed in black and white.          the elderbush    once upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold. he had  gone out and got his feet wet  though nobody could imagine how it had  happened  for it was quite dry weather. so his mother undressed him  put  him to bed  and had the tea-pot brought in  to make him a good cup of  elderflower tea. just at that moment the merry old man came in who  lived up a-top of the house all alone  for he had neither wife nor  children--but he liked children very much  and knew so many fairy tales   that it was quite delightful.    “now drink your tea ” said the boy's mother  “then  perhaps  you may  hear a fairy tale.”    “if i had but something new to tell ” said the old man. “but how did the  child get his feet wet?”    “that is the very thing that nobody can make out ” said his mother.    “am i to hear a fairy tale?” asked the little boy.    “yes  if you can tell me exactly--for i must know that first--how deep  the gutter is in the little street opposite  that you pass through in  going to school.”    “just up to the middle of my boot ” said the child  “but then i must go  into the deep hole.”    “ah  ah! that's where the wet feet came from ” said the old man. “i  ought now to tell you a story  but i don't know any more.”    “you can make one in a moment ” said the little boy. “my mother says  that all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can  find a story in everything.”    “yes  but such tales and stories are good for nothing. the right sort  come of themselves  they tap at my forehead and say  'here we are.'”    “won't there be a tap soon?” asked the little boy. and his mother  laughed  put some elder-flowers in the tea-pot  and poured boiling water  upon them.    “do tell me something! pray do!”    “yes  if a fairy tale would come of its own accord  but they are proud  and haughty  and come only when they choose. stop!” said he  all on a  sudden. “i have it! pay attention! there is one in the tea-pot!”    and the little boy looked at the tea-pot. the cover rose more and more   and the elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white  and shot up long  branches. out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides   and grew larger and larger  it was a splendid elderbush  a whole tree   and it reached into the very bed  and pushed the curtains aside. how  it bloomed! and what an odour! in the middle of the bush sat a  friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress. it was quite  green  like the leaves of the elder  and was trimmed with large white  elder-flowers  so that at first one could not tell whether it was a  stuff  or a natural green and real flowers.    “what's that woman's name?” asked the little boy.    “the greeks and romans ” said the old man  “called her a dryad  but that  we do not understand. the people who live in the new booths [*] have a much  better name for her  they call her 'old granny'--and she it is to  whom you are to pay attention. now listen  and look at the beautiful  elderbush.         * a row of buildings for seamen in copenhagen.    “just such another large blooming elder tree stands near the new booths.  it grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard  and under  it sat  of an afternoon  in the most splendid sunshine  two old  people  an old  old seaman  and his old  old wife. they had  great-grand-children  and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth  anniversary of their marriage  but they could not exactly recollect the  date: and old granny sat in the tree  and looked as pleased as now. 'i  know the date ' said she  but those below did not hear her  for they  were talking about old times.    “'yes  can't you remember when we were very little ' said the old  seaman  'and ran and played about? it was the very same court-yard where  we now are  and we stuck slips in the ground  and made a garden.'    “'i remember it well ' said the old woman  'i remember it quite well. we  watered the slips  and one of them was an elderbush. it took root  put  forth green shoots  and grew up to be the large tree under which we old  folks are now sitting.'    “'to be sure ' said he. 'and there in the corner stood a waterpail   where i used to swim my boats.'    “'true  but first we went to school to learn somewhat ' said she  'and  then we were confirmed. we both cried  but in the afternoon we went up  the round tower  and looked down on copenhagen  and far  far away over  the water  then we went to friedericksberg  where the king and the queen  were sailing about in their splendid barges.'    “'but i had a different sort of sailing to that  later  and that  too   for many a year  a long way off  on great voyages.'    “'yes  many a time have i wept for your sake ' said she. 'i thought you  were dead and gone  and lying down in the deep waters. many a night have  i got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had  sure  enough  but you never came. i remember so well one day  when the rain  was pouring down in torrents  the scavengers were before the house where  i was in service  and i had come up with the dust  and remained standing  at the door--it was dreadful weather--when just as i was there  the  postman came and gave me a letter. it was from you! what a tour that  letter had made! i opened it instantly and read: i laughed and wept.  i was so happy. in it i read that you were in warm lands where the  coffee-tree grows. what a blessed land that must be! you related so  much  and i saw it all the while the rain was pouring down  and i  standing there with the dust-box. at the same moment came someone who  embraced me.'    “'yes  but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!'    “'but i did not know it was you. you arrived as soon as your letter   and you were so handsome--that you still are--and had a long yellow silk  handkerchief round your neck  and a bran new hat on  oh  you were so  dashing! good heavens! what weather it was  and what a state the street  was in!'    “'and then we married ' said he. 'don't you remember? and then we  had our first little boy  and then mary  and nicholas  and peter  and  christian.'    “'yes  and how they all grew up to be honest people  and were beloved by  everybody.'    “'and their children also have children ' said the old sailor  'yes   those are our grand-children  full of strength and vigor. it was   methinks about this season that we had our wedding.'    “'yes  this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage ' said  old granny  sticking her head between the two old people  who thought  it was their neighbor who nodded to them. they looked at each other and  held one another by the hand. soon after came their children  and their  grand-children  for they knew well enough that it was the day of the  fiftieth anniversary  and had come with their gratulations that very  morning  but the old people had forgotten it  although they were able  to remember all that had happened many years ago. and the elderbush sent  forth a strong odour in the sun  that was just about to set  and shone  right in the old people's faces. they both looked so rosy-cheeked  and  the youngest of the grandchildren danced around them  and called out  quite delighted  that there was to be something very splendid that  evening--they were all to have hot potatoes. and old nanny nodded in the  bush  and shouted 'hurrah!' with the rest.”    “but that is no fairy tale ” said the little boy  who was listening to  the story.    “the thing is  you must understand it ” said the narrator  “let us ask  old nanny.”    “that was no fairy tale  'tis true ” said old nanny  “but now it's  coming. the most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is  reality  were that not the case  you know  my magnificent elderbush  could not have grown out of the tea-pot.” and then she took the little  boy out of bed  laid him on her bosom  and the branches of the elder  tree  full of flowers  closed around her. they sat in an aerial  dwelling  and it flew with them through the air. oh  it was wondrous  beautiful! old nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty  maiden  but her robe was still the same green stuff with white flowers   which she had worn before. on her bosom she had a real elderflower   and in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers  her eyes were so  large and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them  she kissed the  boy  and now they were of the same age and felt alike.    hand in hand they went out of the bower  and they were standing in the  beautiful garden of their home. near the green lawn papa's walking-stick  was tied  and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life  for  as soon as they got astride it  the round polished knob was turned into  a magnificent neighing head  a long black mane fluttered in the breeze   and four slender yet strong legs shot out. the animal was strong and  handsome  and away they went at full gallop round the lawn.    “huzza! now we are riding miles off ” said the boy. “we are riding away  to the castle where we were last year!”    and on they rode round the grass-plot  and the little maiden  who  we  know  was no one else but old nanny  kept on crying out  “now we are in  the country! don't you see the farm-house yonder? and there is an elder  tree standing beside it  and the cock is scraping away the earth for the  hens  look  how he struts! and now we are close to the church. it lies  high upon the hill  between the large oak-trees  one of which is half  decayed. and now we are by the smithy  where the fire is blazing  and  where the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks  fly about. away! away! to the beautiful country-seat!”    and all that the little maiden  who sat behind on the stick  spoke of   flew by in reality. the boy saw it all  and yet they were only going  round the grass-plot. then they played in a side avenue  and marked out  a little garden on the earth  and they took elder-blossoms from their  hair  planted them  and they grew just like those the old people planted  when they were children  as related before. they went hand in hand  as  the old people had done when they were children  but not to the round  tower  or to friedericksberg  no  the little damsel wound her arms round  the boy  and then they flew far away through all denmark. and spring  came  and summer  and then it was autumn  and then winter  and a  thousand pictures were reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy   and the little girl always sang to him  “this you will never forget.”   and during their whole flight the elder tree smelt so sweet and odorous   he remarked the roses and the fresh beeches  but the elder tree had  a more wondrous fragrance  for its flowers hung on the breast of the  little maiden  and there  too  did he often lay his head during the  flight.    “it is lovely here in spring!” said the young maiden. and they stood in  a beech-wood that had just put on its first green  where the woodroof [*]  at their feet sent forth its fragrance  and the pale-red anemony looked  so pretty among the verdure. “oh  would it were always spring in the  sweetly-smelling danish beech-forests!”         * asperula odorata.    “it is lovely here in summer!” said she. and she flew past old castles  of by-gone days of chivalry  where the red walls and the embattled  gables were mirrored in the canal  where the swans were swimming  and  peered up into the old cool avenues. in the fields the corn was waving  like the sea  in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing  while  wild-drone flowers  and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the  hedges  and towards evening the moon rose round and large  and the  haycocks in the meadows smelt so sweetly. “this one never forgets!”    “it is lovely here in autumn!” said the little maiden. and suddenly the  atmosphere grew as blue again as before  the forest grew red  and green   and yellow-colored. the dogs came leaping along  and whole flocks of  wild-fowl flew over the cairn  where blackberry-bushes were hanging  round the old stones. the sea was dark blue  covered with ships full  of white sails  and in the barn old women  maidens  and children were  sitting picking hops into a large cask  the young sang songs  but the  old told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. nothing could  be more charming.    “it is delightful here in winter!” said the little maiden. and all the  trees were covered with hoar-frost  they looked like white corals  the  snow crackled under foot  as if one had new boots on  and one falling  star after the other was seen in the sky. the christmas-tree was lighted  in the room  presents were there  and good-humor reigned. in the country  the violin sounded in the room of the peasant  the newly-baked cakes  were attacked  even the poorest child said  “it is really delightful  here in winter!”    yes  it was delightful  and the little maiden showed the boy everything   and the elder tree still was fragrant  and the red flag  with the white  cross  was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the new  booths had sailed. and the boy grew up to be a lad  and was to go forth  in the wide world-far  far away to warm lands  where the coffee-tree  grows  but at his departure the little maiden took an elder-blossom from  her bosom  and gave it him to keep  and it was placed between the leaves  of his prayer-book  and when in foreign lands he opened the book  it  was always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay  and the more he  looked at it  the fresher it became  he felt as it were  the fragrance  of the danish groves  and from among the leaves of the flowers he could  distinctly see the little maiden  peeping forth with her bright blue  eyes--and then she whispered  “it is delightful here in spring  summer   autumn  and winter”  and a hundred visions glided before his mind.    thus passed many years  and he was now an old man  and sat with his old  wife under the blooming tree. they held each other by the hand  as the  old grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the new booths did  and they  talked exactly like them of old times  and of the fiftieth anniversary  of their wedding. the little maiden  with the blue eyes  and with  elder-blossoms in her hair  sat in the tree  nodded to both of them   and said  “to-day is the fiftieth anniversary!” and then she took two  flowers out of her hair  and kissed them. first  they shone like silver   then like gold  and when they laid them on the heads of the old people   each flower became a golden crown. so there they both sat  like a king  and a queen  under the fragrant tree  that looked exactly like an elder:  the old man told his wife the story of “old nanny ” as it had been told  him when a boy. and it seemed to both of them it contained much that  resembled their own history  and those parts that were like it pleased  them best.    “thus it is ” said the little maiden in the tree  “some call me 'old  nanny ' others a 'dryad ' but  in reality  my name is 'remembrance'   'tis i who sit in the tree that grows and grows! i can remember  i can  tell things! let me see if you have my flower still?”    and the old man opened his prayer-book. there lay the elder-blossom   as fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before  and  remembrance nodded  and the old people  decked with crowns of gold  sat  in the flush of the evening sun. they closed their eyes  and--and--!  yes  that's the end of the story!    the little boy lay in his bed  he did not know if he had dreamed or  not  or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. the  tea-pot was standing on the table  but no elder tree was growing out  of it! and the old man  who had been talking  was just on the point of  going out at the door  and he did go.    “how splendid that was!” said the little boy. “mother  i have been to  warm countries.”    “so i should think ” said his mother. “when one has drunk two good  cupfuls of elder-flower tea  'tis likely enough one goes into warm  climates”  and she tucked him up nicely  least he should take cold. “you  have had a good sleep while i have been sitting here  and arguing with  him whether it was a story or a fairy tale.”    “and where is old nanny?” asked the little boy.    “in the tea-pot ” said his mother  “and there she may remain.”          the bell    people said “the evening bell is sounding  the sun is setting.” for a  strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town.  it was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a  moment  for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude  made too great a noise.    those persons who were walking outside the town  where the houses were  farther apart  with gardens or little fields between them  could see  the evening sky still better  and heard the sound of the bell much  more distinctly. it was as if the tones came from a church in the still  forest  people looked thitherward  and felt their minds attuned most  solemnly.    a long time passed  and people said to each other--“i wonder if there  is a church out in the wood? the bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet   let us stroll thither  and examine the matter nearer.” and the rich  people drove out  and the poor walked  but the way seemed strangely  long to them  and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the  skirts of the forest  they sat down  and looked up at the long  branches  and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. the  confectioner of the town came out  and set up his booth there  and soon  after came another confectioner  who hung a bell over his stand  as  a sign or ornament  but it had no clapper  and it was tarred over to  preserve it from the rain. when all the people returned home  they said  it had been very romantic  and that it was quite a different sort of  thing to a pic-nic or tea-party. there were three persons who asserted  they had penetrated to the end of the forest  and that they had always  heard the wonderful sounds of the bell  but it had seemed to them as if  it had come from the town. one wrote a whole poem about it  and said the  bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child  and  that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. the king of the  country was also observant of it  and vowed that he who could discover  whence the sounds proceeded  should have the title of “universal  bell-ringer ” even if it were not really a bell.    many persons now went to the wood  for the sake of getting the place   but one only returned with a sort of explanation  for nobody went far  enough  that one not further than the others. however  he said that  the sound proceeded from a very large owl  in a hollow tree  a sort of  learned owl  that continually knocked its head against the branches. but  whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree  that no  one could say with certainty. so now he got the place of “universal  bell-ringer ” and wrote yearly a short treatise “on the owl”  but  everybody was just as wise as before.    it was the day of confirmation. the clergyman had spoken so touchingly   the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved  it was  an eventful day for them  from children they become all at once  grown-up-persons  it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all  at once into persons with more understanding. the sun was shining  gloriously  the children that had been confirmed went out of the town   and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell  with wonderful distinctness. they all immediately felt a wish to go  thither  all except three. one of them had to go home to try on a  ball-dress  for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her  to be confirmed this time  for otherwise she would not have come   the other was a poor boy  who had borrowed his coat and boots to be  confirmed in from the innkeeper's son  and he was to give them back by  a certain hour  the third said that he never went to a strange place  if his parents were not with him--that he had always been a good boy  hitherto  and would still be so now that he was confirmed  and that one  ought not to laugh at him for it: the others  however  did make fun of  him  after all.    there were three  therefore  that did not go  the others hastened on.  the sun shone  the birds sang  and the children sang too  and each held  the other by the hand  for as yet they had none of them any high office   and were all of equal rank in the eye of god.    but two of the youngest soon grew tired  and both returned to town  two  little girls sat down  and twined garlands  so they did not go either   and when the others reached the willow-tree  where the confectioner was   they said  “now we are there! in reality the bell does not exist  it is  only a fancy that people have taken into their heads!”    at the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood  so clear and  solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. it  was so thick  and the foliage so dense  that it was quite fatiguing  to proceed. woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high  blooming  convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to  tree  where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was  very beautiful  but it was no place for girls to go  their clothes would  get so torn. large blocks of stone lay there  overgrown with moss of  every color  the fresh spring bubbled forth  and made a strange gurgling  sound.    “that surely cannot be the bell ” said one of the children  lying down  and listening. “this must be looked to.” so he remained  and let the  others go on without him.    they afterwards came to a little house  made of branches and the bark of  trees  a large wild apple-tree bent over it  as if it would shower down  all its blessings on the roof  where roses were blooming. the long stems  twined round the gable  on which there hung a small bell.    was it that which people had heard? yes  everybody was unanimous on the  subject  except one  who said that the bell was too small and too fine  to be heard at so great a distance  and besides it was very different  tones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. it was a  king's son who spoke  whereon the others said  “such people always want  to be wiser than everybody else.”    they now let him go on alone  and as he went  his breast was filled more  and more with the forest solitude  but he still heard the little bell  with which the others were so satisfied  and now and then  when the  wind blew  he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea  where the confectioner had his tent  but the deep sound of the bell rose  louder  it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it  and the tones  came from the left hand  the side where the heart is placed. a rustling  was heard in the bushes  and a little boy stood before the king's son  a  boy in wooden shoes  and with so short a jacket that one could see what  long wrists he had. both knew each other: the boy was that one among  the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his  jacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. this he had done  and was now  going on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress  for the bell sounded  with so deep a tone  and with such strange power  that proceed he must.    “why  then  we can go together ” said the king's son. but the poor  child that had been confirmed was quite ashamed  he looked at his wooden  shoes  pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket  and said that he was  afraid he could not walk so fast  besides  he thought that the bell must  be looked for to the right  for that was the place where all sorts of  beautiful things were to be found.    “but there we shall not meet ” said the king's son  nodding at the same  time to the poor boy  who went into the darkest  thickest part of the  wood  where thorns tore his humble dress  and scratched his face and  hands and feet till they bled. the king's son got some scratches too   but the sun shone on his path  and it is him that we will follow  for he  was an excellent and resolute youth.    “i must and will find the bell ” said he  “even if i am obliged to go to  the end of the world.”    the ugly apes sat upon the trees  and grinned. “shall we thrash him?”   said they. “shall we thrash him? he is the son of a king!”    but on he went  without being disheartened  deeper and deeper into the  wood  where the most wonderful flowers were growing. there stood white  lilies with blood-red stamina  skyblue tulips  which shone as they waved  in the winds  and apple-trees  the apples of which looked exactly like  large soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the  sunshine! around the nicest green meads  where the deer were playing in  the grass  grew magnificent oaks and beeches  and if the bark of one of  the trees was cracked  there grass and long creeping plants grew in  the crevices. and there were large calm lakes there too  in which white  swans were swimming  and beat the air with their wings. the king's son  often stood still and listened. he thought the bell sounded from the  depths of these still lakes  but then he remarked again that the tone  proceeded not from there  but farther off  from out the depths of the  forest.    the sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. it was still in the  woods  so very still  and he fell on his knees  sung his evening hymn   and said: “i cannot find what i seek  the sun is going down  and night  is coming--the dark  dark night. yet perhaps i may be able once more  to see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. i will climb up  yonder rock.”    and he seized hold of the creeping-plants  and the roots of  trees--climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing  and the toads were croaking--and he gained the summit before the sun  had quite gone down. how magnificent was the sight from this height! the  sea--the great  the glorious sea  that dashed its long waves against the  coast--was stretched out before him. and yonder  where sea and sky meet   stood the sun  like a large shining altar  all melted together in the  most glowing colors. and the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing   and his heart sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church   in which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars  flowers and  grass the velvet carpeting  and heaven itself the large cupola. the red  colors above faded away as the sun vanished  but a million stars were  lighted  a million lamps shone  and the king's son spread out his arms  towards heaven  and wood  and sea  when at the same moment  coming by  a path to the right  appeared  in his wooden shoes and jacket  the poor  boy who had been confirmed with him. he had followed his own path  and  had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. they  ran towards each other  and stood together hand in hand in the vast  church of nature and of poetry  while over them sounded the invisible  holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them  and lifted up their  voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!          the old house    in the street  up there  was an old  a very old house--it was almost  three hundred years old  for that might be known by reading the great  beam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and  hop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times  and over  every window was a distorted face cut out in the beam. the one story  stood forward a great way over the other  and directly under the eaves  was a leaden spout with a dragon's head  the rain-water should have run  out of the mouth  but it ran out of the belly  for there was a hole in  the spout.    all the other houses in the street were so new and so neat  with large  window panes and smooth walls  one could easily see that they would have  nothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought  “how long is  that old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? and  then the projecting windows stand so far out  that no one can see from  our windows what happens in that direction! the steps are as broad as  those of a palace  and as high as to a church tower. the iron railings  look just like the door to an old family vault  and then they have brass  tops--that's so stupid!”    on the other side of the street were also new and neat houses  and they  thought just as the others did  but at the window opposite the old house  there sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes:  he certainly liked the old house best  and that both in sunshine and  moonshine. and when he looked across at the wall where the mortar  had fallen out  he could sit and find out there the strangest figures  imaginable  exactly as the street had appeared before  with steps   projecting windows  and pointed gables  he could see soldiers with  halberds  and spouts where the water ran  like dragons and serpents.  that was a house to look at  and there lived an old man  who wore plush  breeches  and he had a coat with large brass buttons  and a wig that one  could see was a real wig. every morning there came an old fellow to him  who put his rooms in order  and went on errands  otherwise  the old man  in the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house. now and then he  came to the window and looked out  and the little boy nodded to him   and the old man nodded again  and so they became acquaintances  and then  they were friends  although they had never spoken to each other--but  that made no difference. the little boy heard his parents say  “the old  man opposite is very well off  but he is so very  very lonely!”    the sunday following  the little boy took something  and wrapped it up  in a piece of paper  went downstairs  and stood in the doorway  and when  the man who went on errands came past  he said to him--    “i say  master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me?  i have two pewter soldiers--this is one of them  and he shall have it   for i know he is so very  very lonely.”    and the old errand man looked quite pleased  nodded  and took the pewter  soldier over to the old house. afterwards there came a message  it was  to ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a  visit  and so he got permission of his parents  and then went over to  the old house.    and the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever   one would have thought they were polished on account of the visit  and  it was as if the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters  who  stood in tulips  carved out on the door--blew with all their  might  their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before. yes  they  blew--“trateratra! the little boy comes! trateratra!”--and then the door  opened.    the whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor  and  ladies in silken gowns  and the armor rattled  and the silken gowns  rustled! and then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way  upwards  and a little way downwards  and then one came on a balcony  which was in a very dilapidated state  sure enough  with large holes and  long crevices  but grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether   for the whole balcony outside  the yard  and the walls  were overgrown  with so much green stuff  that it looked like a garden  only a balcony.  here stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears  and the flowers  grew just as they liked. one of the pots was quite overrun on all sides  with pinks  that is to say  with the green part  shoot stood by shoot   and it said quite distinctly  “the air has cherished me  the sun has  kissed me  and promised me a little flower on sunday! a little flower on  sunday!”    and then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog's  leather  and printed with gold flowers.       “the gilding decays      but hog's leather stays!”    said the walls.    and there stood easy-chairs  with such high backs  and so carved out   and with arms on both sides. “sit down! sit down!” said they. “ugh! how  i creak  now i shall certainly get the gout  like the old clothespress   ugh!”    and then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows  were  and where the old man sat.    “i thank you for the pewter soldier  my little friend!” said the old  man. “and i thank you because you come over to me.”    “thankee! thankee!” or “cranky! cranky!” sounded from all the furniture   there was so much of it  that each article stood in the other's way  to  get a look at the little boy.    in the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady   so young  so glad  but dressed quite as in former times  with clothes  that stood quite stiff  and with powder in her hair  she neither said  “thankee  thankee!” nor “cranky  cranky!” but looked with her mild eyes  at the little boy  who directly asked the old man  “where did you get  her?”    “yonder  at the broker's ” said the old man  “where there are so many  pictures hanging. no one knows or cares about them  for they are all of  them buried  but i knew her in by-gone days  and now she has been dead  and gone these fifty years!”    under the picture  in a glazed frame  there hung a bouquet of withered  flowers  they were almost fifty years old  they looked so very old!    the pendulum of the great clock went to and fro  and the hands turned   and everything in the room became still older  but they did not observe  it.    “they say at home ” said the little boy  “that you are so very  very  lonely!”    “oh!” said he. “the old thoughts  with what they may bring with them   come and visit me  and now you also come! i am very well off!”    then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf  there were  whole long processions and pageants  with the strangest characters   which one never sees now-a-days  soldiers like the knave of clubs   and citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs  with a pair of  shears held by two lions--and the shoemakers theirs  without boots   but with an eagle that had two heads  for the shoemakers must have  everything so that they can say  it is a pair! yes  that was a picture  book!    the old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves  apples  and  nuts--yes  it was delightful over there in the old house.    “i cannot bear it any longer!” said the pewter soldier  who sat on the  drawers. “it is so lonely and melancholy here! but when one has been in  a family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! i cannot bear  it any longer! the whole day is so long  and the evenings are still  longer! here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home  where  your father and mother spoke so pleasantly  and where you and all your  sweet children made such a delightful noise. nay  how lonely the old man  is--do you think that he gets kisses? do you think he gets mild eyes   or a christmas tree? he will get nothing but a grave! i can bear it no  longer!”    “you must not let it grieve you so much ” said the little boy. “i find  it so very delightful here  and then all the old thoughts  with what  they may bring with them  they come and visit here.”    “yes  it's all very well  but i see nothing of them  and i don't know  them!” said the pewter soldier. “i cannot bear it!”    “but you must!” said the little boy.    then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face  the most  delicious preserves  apples  and nuts  and so the little boy thought no  more about the pewter soldier.    the little boy returned home happy and pleased  and weeks and days  passed away  and nods were made to the old house  and from the old  house  and then the little boy went over there again.    the carved trumpeters blew  “trateratra! there is the little boy!  trateratra!” and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled   and the silk gowns rustled  the hog's leather spoke  and the old chairs  had the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: ugh! it was  exactly like the first time  for over there one day and hour was just  like another.    “i cannot bear it!” said the pewter soldier. “i have shed pewter tears!  it is too melancholy! rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and  legs! it would at least be a change. i cannot bear it longer! now  i  know what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts  with what they  may bring with them! i have had a visit from mine  and you may be sure  it is no pleasant thing in the end  i was at last about to jump down  from the drawers.    “i saw you all over there at home so distinctly  as if you really were  here  it was again that sunday morning  all you children stood before  the table and sung your psalms  as you do every morning. you stood  devoutly with folded hands  and father and mother were just as pious   and then the door was opened  and little sister mary  who is not two  years old yet  and who always dances when she hears music or singing  of  whatever kind it may be  was put into the room--though she ought not to  have been there--and then she began to dance  but could not keep time   because the tones were so long  and then she stood  first on the one  leg  and bent her head forwards  and then on the other leg  and bent  her head forwards--but all would not do. you stood very seriously all  together  although it was difficult enough  but i laughed to myself  and  then i fell off the table  and got a bump  which i have still--for it  was not right of me to laugh. but the whole now passes before me again  in thought  and everything that i have lived to see  and these are the  old thoughts  with what they may bring with them.    “tell me if you still sing on sundays? tell me something about little  mary! and how my comrade  the other pewter soldier  lives! yes  he is  happy enough  that's sure! i cannot bear it any longer!”    “you are given away as a present!” said the little boy. “you must  remain. can you not understand that?”    the old man now came with a drawer  in which there was much to be seen   both “tin boxes” and “balsam boxes ” old cards  so large and so gilded   such as one never sees them now. and several drawers were opened  and  the piano was opened  it had landscapes on the inside of the lid  and it  was so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then he hummed a song.    “yes  she could sing that!” said he  and nodded to the portrait  which  he had bought at the broker's  and the old man's eyes shone so bright!    “i will go to the wars! i will go to the wars!” shouted the pewter  soldier as loud as he could  and threw himself off the drawers right  down on the floor. what became of him? the old man sought  and the  little boy sought  he was away  and he stayed away.    “i shall find him!” said the old man  but he never found him. the floor  was too open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice  and there  he lay as in an open tomb.    that day passed  and the little boy went home  and that week passed   and several weeks too. the windows were quite frozen  the little boy was  obliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old  house  and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and  inscriptions  it lay quite up over the steps  just as if there was no  one at home--nor was there any one at home--the old man was dead!    in the evening there was a hearse seen before the door  and he was borne  into it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country  to lie in  his grave. he was driven out there  but no one followed  all his friends  were dead  and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was  driven away.    some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house  and the  little boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the  old ladies away  the flower-pots with the long ears  the old chairs  and  the old clothes-presses. something came here  and something came there   the portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the  broker's again  and there it hung  for no one knew her more--no one  cared about the old picture.    in the spring they pulled the house down  for  as people said  it was  a ruin. one could see from the street right into the room with the  hog's-leather hanging  which was slashed and torn  and the green grass  and leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams.  and then it was put to rights.    “that was a relief ” said the neighboring houses.    a fine house was built there  with large windows  and smooth white  walls  but before it  where the old house had in fact stood  was a  little garden laid out  and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the  neighboring house. before the garden there was a large iron railing  with an iron door  it looked quite splendid  and people stood still and  peeped in  and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine  and chattered  away at each other as well as they could  but it was not about the old  house  for they could not remember it  so many years had passed--so many  that the little boy had grown up to a whole man  yes  a clever man  and  a pleasure to his parents  and he had just been married  and  together  with his little wife  had come to live in the house here  where the  garden was  and he stood by her there whilst she planted a field-flower  that she found so pretty  she planted it with her little hand  and  pressed the earth around it with her fingers. oh! what was that? she  had stuck herself. there sat something pointed  straight out of the soft  mould.    it was--yes  guess! it was the pewter soldier  he that was lost up at  the old man's  and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and  the rubbish  and had at last laid for many years in the ground.    the young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier  first with a green leaf   and then with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell   that it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a  trance.    “let me see him ” said the young man. he laughed  and then shook his  head. “nay  it cannot be he  but he reminds me of a story about a pewter  soldier which i had when i was a little boy!” and then he told his wife  about the old house  and the old man  and about the pewter soldier that  he sent over to him because he was so very  very lonely  and he told it  as correctly as it had really been  so that the tears came into the eyes  of his young wife  on account of the old house and the old man.    “it may possibly be  however  that it is the same pewter soldier!” said  she. “i will take care of it  and remember all that you have told me   but you must show me the old man's grave!”    “but i do not know it ” said he  “and no one knows it! all his friends  were dead  no one took care of it  and i was then a little boy!”    “how very  very lonely he must have been!” said she.    “very  very lonely!” said the pewter soldier. “but it is delightful not  to be forgotten!”    “delightful!” shouted something close by  but no one  except the pewter  soldier  saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings  it had  lost all its gilding  it looked like a piece of wet clay  but it had an  opinion  and it gave it:       “the gilding decays      but hog's leather stays!”    this the pewter soldier did not believe.          the happy family    really  the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf  if one  holds it before one  it is like a whole apron  and if one holds it over  one's head in rainy weather  it is almost as good as an umbrella  for  it is so immensely large. the burdock never grows alone  but where there  grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight  and all this  delightfulness is snails' food. the great white snails which persons of  quality in former times made fricassees of  ate  and said  “hem   hem! how delicious!” for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on  dock-leaves  and therefore burdock seeds were sown.    now  there was an old manor-house  where they no longer ate snails  they  were quite extinct  but the burdocks were not extinct  they grew and  grew all over the walks and all the beds  they could not get the mastery  over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. here and there stood an  apple and a plum-tree  or else one never would have thought that it was  a garden  all was burdocks  and there lived the two last venerable old  snails.    they themselves knew not how old they were  but they could remember  very well that there had been many more  that they were of a family  from foreign lands  and that for them and theirs the whole forest was  planted. they had never been outside it  but they knew that there was  still something more in the world  which was called the manor-house  and  that there they were boiled  and then they became black  and were then  placed on a silver dish  but what happened further they knew not  or  in  fact  what it was to be boiled  and to lie on a silver dish  they could  not possibly imagine  but it was said to be delightful  and particularly  genteel. neither the chafers  the toads  nor the earth-worms  whom they  asked about it could give them any information--none of them had been  boiled or laid on a silver dish.    the old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the  world  that they knew  the forest was planted for their sake  and the  manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver  dish.    now they lived a very lonely and happy life  and as they had no children  themselves  they had adopted a little common snail  which they brought  up as their own  but the little one would not grow  for he was of a  common family  but the old ones  especially dame mother snail  thought  they could observe how he increased in size  and she begged father   if he could not see it  that he would at least feel the little snail's  shell  and then he felt it  and found the good dame was right.    one day there was a heavy storm of rain.    “hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!” said father snail.    “there are also rain-drops!” said mother snail. “and now the rain pours  right down the stalk! you will see that it will be wet here! i am very  happy to think that we have our good house  and the little one has  his also! there is more done for us than for all other creatures  sure  enough  but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world?  we are provided with a house from our birth  and the burdock forest is  planted for our sakes! i should like to know how far it extends  and  what there is outside!”    “there is nothing at all ” said father snail. “no place can be better  than ours  and i have nothing to wish for!”    “yes ” said the dame. “i would willingly go to the manorhouse  be  boiled  and laid on a silver dish  all our forefathers have been treated  so  there is something extraordinary in it  you may be sure!”    “the manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!” said father snail. “or  the burdocks have grown up over it  so that they cannot come out. there  need not  however  be any haste about that  but you are always in such a  tremendous hurry  and the little one is beginning to be the same. has he  not been creeping up that stalk these three days? it gives me a headache  when i look up to him!”    “you must not scold him ” said mother snail. “he creeps so carefully  he  will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for!  but have you not thought of it? where shall we get a wife for him? do  you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in  the interior of the burdock forest?”    “black snails  i dare say  there are enough of ” said the old one.  “black snails without a house--but they are so common  and so conceited.  but we might give the ants a commission to look out for us  they run  to and fro as if they had something to do  and they certainly know of a  wife for our little snail!”    “i know one  sure enough--the most charming one!” said one of the ants.  “but i am afraid we shall hardly succeed  for she is a queen!”    “that is nothing!” said the old folks. “has she a house?”    “she has a palace!” said the ant. “the finest ant's palace  with seven  hundred passages!”    “i thank you!” said mother snail. “our son shall not go into an  ant-hill  if you know nothing better than that  we shall give the  commission to the white gnats. they fly far and wide  in rain and  sunshine  they know the whole forest here  both within and without.”    “we have a wife for him ” said the gnats. “at a hundred human paces from  here there sits a little snail in her house  on a gooseberry bush  she  is quite lonely  and old enough to be married. it is only a hundred  human paces!”    “well  then  let her come to him!” said the old ones. “he has a whole  forest of burdocks  she has only a bush!”    and so they went and fetched little miss snail. it was a whole week  before she arrived  but therein was just the very best of it  for one  could thus see that she was of the same species.    and then the marriage was celebrated. six earth-worms shone as well as  they could. in other respects the whole went off very quietly  for the  old folks could not bear noise and merriment  but old dame snail made  a brilliant speech. father snail could not speak  he was too much  affected  and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance  the whole  forest of burdocks  and said--what they had always said--that it was  the best in the world  and if they lived honestly and decently  and  increased and multiplied  they and their children would once in the  course of time come to the manor-house  be boiled black  and laid on  silver dishes. after this speech was made  the old ones crept into their  shells  and never more came out. they slept  the young couple governed  in the forest  and had a numerous progeny  but they were never boiled   and never came on the silver dishes  so from this they concluded that  the manor-house had fallen to ruins  and that all the men in the world  were extinct  and as no one contradicted them  so  of course it was so.  and the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake   and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their  sakes  and they were very happy  and the whole family was happy  for  they  indeed were so.          the story of a mother    a mother sat there with her little child. she was so downcast  so  afraid that it should die! it was so pale  the small eyes had closed  themselves  and it drew its breath so softly  now and then  with a  deep respiration  as if it sighed  and the mother looked still more  sorrowfully on the little creature.    then a knocking was heard at the door  and in came a poor old man  wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth  for it warms one  and he needed  it  as it was the cold winter season! everything out-of-doors was  covered with ice and snow  and the wind blew so that it cut the face.    as the old man trembled with cold  and the little child slept a moment   the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove   that it might be warm for him  the old man sat and rocked the cradle   and the mother sat down on a chair close by him  and looked at her  little sick child that drew its breath so deep  and raised its little  hand.    “do you not think that i shall save him?” said she. “our lord will not  take him from me!”    and the old man--it was death himself--he nodded so strangely  it could  just as well signify yes as no. and the mother looked down in her lap   and the tears ran down over her cheeks  her head became so heavy--she  had not closed her eyes for three days and nights  and now she slept   but only for a minute  when she started up and trembled with cold.    “what is that?” said she  and looked on all sides  but the old man was  gone  and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him  and the  old clock in the corner burred  and burred  the great leaden weight ran  down to the floor  bump! and then the clock also stood still.    but the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.    out there  in the midst of the snow  there sat a woman in long  black  clothes  and she said  “death has been in thy chamber  and i saw him  hasten away with thy little child  he goes faster than the wind  and he  never brings back what he takes!”    “oh  only tell me which way he went!” said the mother. “tell me the way   and i shall find him!”    “i know it!” said the woman in the black clothes. “but before i tell it   thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child!  i am fond of them. i have heard them before  i am night  i saw thy tears  whilst thou sang'st them!”    “i will sing them all  all!” said the mother. “but do not stop me now--i  may overtake him--i may find my child!”    but night stood still and mute. then the mother wrung her hands  sang  and wept  and there were many songs  but yet many more tears  and then  night said  “go to the right  into the dark pine forest  thither i saw  death take his way with thy little child!”    the roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest  and she no  longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush   there was neither leaf nor flower on it  it was also in the cold winter  season  and ice-flakes hung on the branches.    “hast thou not seen death go past with my little child?” said the  mother.    “yes ” said the thorn-bush  “but i will not tell thee which way he took   unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. i am freezing to death   i shall become a lump of ice!”    and she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast  so firmly  that it might  be thoroughly warmed  and the thorns went right into her flesh  and her  blood flowed in large drops  but the thornbush shot forth fresh green  leaves  and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night  the heart  of the afflicted mother was so warm  and the thorn-bush told her the way  she should go.    she then came to a large lake  where there was neither ship nor boat.  the lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her  neither was it open   nor low enough that she could wade through it  and across it she must go  if she would find her child! then she lay down to drink up the lake  and  that was an impossibility for a human being  but the afflicted mother  thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.    “oh  what would i not give to come to my child!” said the weeping  mother  and she wept still more  and her eyes sunk down in the depths of  the waters  and became two precious pearls  but the water bore her up   as if she sat in a swing  and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore  on the opposite side  where there stood a mile-broad  strange house  one  knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns  or if it were  built up  but the poor mother could not see it  she had wept her eyes  out.    “where shall i find death  who took away my little child?” said she.    “he has not come here yet!” said the old grave woman  who was appointed  to look after death's great greenhouse! “how have you been able to find  the way hither? and who has helped you?”    “our lord has helped me ” said she. “he is merciful  and you will also  be so! where shall i find my little child?”    “nay  i know not ” said the woman  “and you cannot see! many flowers and  trees have withered this night  death will soon come and plant them over  again! you certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree  or flower  just as everyone happens to be settled  they look like other  plants  but they have pulsations of the heart. children's hearts can  also beat  go after yours  perhaps you may know your child's  but what  will you give me if i tell you what you shall do more?”    “i have nothing to give ” said the afflicted mother  “but i will go to  the world's end for you!”    “nay  i have nothing to do there!” said the woman. “but you can give  me your long black hair  you know yourself that it is fine  and that  i like! you shall have my white hair instead  and that's always  something!”    “do you demand nothing else?” said she. “that i will gladly give you!”   and she gave her her fine black hair  and got the old woman's snow-white  hair instead.    so they went into death's great greenhouse  where flowers and trees  grew strangely into one another. there stood fine hyacinths under glass  bells  and there stood strong-stemmed peonies  there grew water plants   some so fresh  others half sick  the water-snakes lay down on them   and black crabs pinched their stalks. there stood beautiful palm-trees   oaks  and plantains  there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree  and every flower had its name  each of them was a human life  the human  frame still lived--one in china  and another in greenland--round about  in the world. there were large trees in small pots  so that they stood  so stunted in growth  and ready to burst the pots  in other places   there was a little dull flower in rich mould  with moss round about it   and it was so petted and nursed. but the distressed mother bent down  over all the smallest plants  and heard within them how the human heart  beat  and amongst millions she knew her child's.    “there it is!” cried she  and stretched her hands out over a little blue  crocus  that hung quite sickly on one side.    “don't touch the flower!” said the old woman. “but place yourself here   and when death comes--i expect him every moment--do not let him pluck  the flower up  but threaten him that you will do the same with the  others. then he will be afraid! he is responsible for them to our lord   and no one dares to pluck them up before he gives leave.”    all at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall  and the blind  mother could feel that it was death that came.    “how hast thou been able to find thy way hither?” he asked. “how couldst  thou come quicker than i?”    “i am a mother ” said she.    and death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower   but she held her hands fast around his  so tight  and yet afraid that  she should touch one of the leaves. then death blew on her hands  and  she felt that it was colder than the cold wind  and her hands fell down  powerless.    “thou canst not do anything against me!” said death.    “but our lord can!” said she.    “i only do his bidding!” said death. “i am his gardener  i take all his  flowers and trees  and plant them out in the great garden of paradise   in the unknown land  but how they grow there  and how it is there i dare  not tell thee.”    “give me back my child!” said the mother  and she wept and prayed. at  once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by  with each hand   and cried out to death  “i will tear all thy flowers off  for i am in  despair.”    “touch them not!” said death. “thou say'st that thou art so unhappy  and  now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.”    “another mother!” said the poor woman  and directly let go her hold of  both the flowers.    “there  thou hast thine eyes ” said death  “i fished them up from the  lake  they shone so bright  i knew not they were thine. take them again   they are now brighter than before  now look down into the deep well  close by  i shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst  have torn up  and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole  human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.”    and she looked down into the well  and it was a happiness to see how the  one became a blessing to the world  to see how much happiness and joy  were felt everywhere. and she saw the other's life  and it was sorrow  and distress  horror  and wretchedness.    “both of them are god's will!” said death.    “which of them is misfortune's flower and which is that of happiness?”   asked she.    “that i will not tell thee ” said death  “but this thou shalt know from  me  that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou  saw'st--thy own child's future life!”    then the mother screamed with terror  “which of them was my child? tell  it me! save the innocent! save my child from all that misery! rather  take it away! take it into god's kingdom! forget my tears  forget my  prayers  and all that i have done!”    “i do not understand thee!” said death. “wilt thou have thy child again   or shall i go with it there  where thou dost not know!”    then the mother wrung her hands  fell on her knees  and prayed to our  lord: “oh  hear me not when i pray against thy will  which is the best!  hear me not! hear me not!”    and she bowed her head down in her lap  and death took her child and  went with it into the unknown land.          the false collar    there was once a fine gentleman  all of whose moveables were a boot-jack  and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world  and  it is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.    it was so old  that it began to think of marriage  and it happened that  it came to be washed in company with a garter.    “nay!” said the collar. “i never did see anything so slender and so  fine  so soft and so neat. may i not ask your name?”    “that i shall not tell you!” said the garter.    “where do you live?” asked the collar.    but the garter was so bashful  so modest  and thought it was a strange  question to answer.    “you are certainly a girdle ” said the collar  “that is to say an inside  girdle. i see well that you are both for use and ornament  my dear young  lady.”    “i will thank you not to speak to me ” said the garter. “i think i have  not given the least occasion for it.”    “yes! when one is as handsome as you ” said the collar  “that is  occasion enough.”    “don't come so near me  i beg of you!” said the garter. “you look so  much like those men-folks.”    “i am also a fine gentleman ” said the collar. “i have a bootjack and a  hair-comb.”    but that was not true  for it was his master who had them: but he  boasted.    “don't come so near me ” said the garter: “i am not accustomed to it.”    “prude!” exclaimed the collar  and then it was taken out of the  washing-tub. it was starched  hung over the back of a chair in the  sunshine  and was then laid on the ironing-blanket  then came the warm  box-iron. “dear lady!” said the collar. “dear widow-lady! i feel quite  hot. i am quite changed. i begin to unfold myself. you will burn a hole  in me. oh! i offer you my hand.”    “rag!” said the box-iron  and went proudly over the collar: for she  fancied she was a steam-engine  that would go on the railroad and draw  the waggons. “rag!” said the box-iron.    the collar was a little jagged at the edge  and so came the long  scissors to cut off the jagged part. “oh!” said the collar. “you are  certainly the first opera dancer. how well you can stretch your legs  out! it is the most graceful performance i have ever seen. no one can  imitate you.”    “i know it ” said the scissors.    “you deserve to be a baroness ” said the collar. “all that i have is a  fine gentleman  a boot-jack  and a hair-comb. if i only had the barony!”    “do you seek my hand?” said the scissors  for she was angry  and without  more ado  she cut him  and then he was condemned.    “i shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. it is surprising how well  you preserve your teeth  miss ” said the collar. “have you never thought  of being betrothed?”    “yes  of course! you may be sure of that ” said the hair-comb. “i am  betrothed--to the boot-jack!”    “betrothed!” exclaimed the collar. now there was no other to court  and  so he despised it.    a long time passed away  then the collar came into the rag chest at the  paper mill  there was a large company of rags  the fine by themselves   and the coarse by themselves  just as it should be. they all had much to  say  but the collar the most  for he was a real boaster.    “i have had such an immense number of sweethearts!” said the collar.  “i could not be in peace! it is true  i was always a fine starched-up  gentleman! i had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb  which i never used!  you should have seen me then  you should have seen me when i lay down!  i shall never forget my first love--she was a girdle  so fine  so soft   and so charming  she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake!  there was also a widow  who became glowing hot  but i left her standing  till she got black again  there was also the first opera dancer  she  gave me that cut which i now go with  she was so ferocious! my  own hair-comb was in love with me  she lost all her teeth from the  heart-ache  yes  i have lived to see much of that sort of thing  but i  am extremely sorry for the garter--i mean the girdle--that went into the  water-tub. i have much on my conscience  i want to become white paper!”    and it became so  all the rags were turned into white paper  but the  collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see   and on which the story is printed  and that was because it boasted so  terribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. it would be well  for us to beware  that we may not act in a similar manner  for we can  never know if we may not  in the course of time  also come into the  rag chest  and be made into white paper  and then have our whole life's  history printed on it  even the most secret  and be obliged to run about  and tell it ourselves  just like this collar.          the shadow    it is in the hot lands that the sun burns  sure enough! there the people  become quite a mahogany brown  ay  and in the hottest lands they are  burnt to negroes. but now it was only to the hot lands that a learned  man had come from the cold  there he thought that he could run about  just as when at home  but he soon found out his mistake.    he  and all sensible folks  were obliged to stay within doors--the  window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day  it looked as if the  whole house slept  or there was no one at home.    the narrow street with the high houses  was built so that the sunshine  must fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be  borne.    the learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man  and seemed to  be a clever man--sat in a glowing oven  it took effect on him  he became  quite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in  for the sun had also an effect  on it. it was first towards evening when the sun was down  that they  began to freshen up again.    in the warm lands every window has a balcony  and the people came out on  all the balconies in the street--for one must have air  even if one be  accustomed to be mahogany!* it was lively both up and down the  street. tailors  and shoemakers  and all the folks  moved out into the  street--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes   above a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other  sung  and people walked and church-bells rang  and asses went along with  a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. the street boys were  screaming and hooting  and shouting and shooting  with devils and  detonating balls--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers--for  there were funerals with psalm and hymn--and then the din of carriages  driving and company arriving: yes  it was  in truth  lively enough down  in the street. only in that single house  which stood opposite that in  which the learned foreigner lived  it was quite still  and yet some one  lived there  for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so  well in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were  watered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there.  the door opposite was also opened late in the evening  but it was dark  within  at least in the front room  further in there was heard the sound  of music. the learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous  but now--it  might be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous  out there  in the warm lands  if there had only been no sun. the  stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house  opposite  one saw no person about  and as to the music  it appeared  to him to be extremely tiresome. “it is as if some one sat there  and  practised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece. 'i  shall master it!' says he  but yet he cannot master it  however long he  plays.”    * the word mahogany can be understood  in danish  as having two  meanings. in general  it means the reddish-brown wood itself  but in  jest  it signifies “excessively fine ” which arose from an anecdote of  nyboder  in copenhagen  (the seamen's quarter.) a sailor's wife  who was  always proud and fine  in her way  came to her neighbor  and complained  that she had got a splinter in her finger. “what of?” asked the  neighbor's wife. “it is a mahogany splinter ” said the other. “mahogany!  it cannot be less with you!” exclaimed the woman--and thence the  proverb  “it is so mahogany!”--(that is  so excessively fine)--is  derived.      one night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony  open--the curtain before it was raised by the wind  and he thought  that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house  all the  flowers shone like flames  in the most beautiful colors  and in the  midst of the flowers stood a slender  graceful maiden--it was as if she  also shone  the light really hurt his eyes. he now opened them quite  wide--yes  he was quite awake  with one spring he was on the floor  he  crept gently behind the curtain  but the maiden was gone  the flowers  shone no longer  but there they stood  fresh and blooming as ever   the door was ajar  and  far within  the music sounded so soft and  delightful  one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. yet  it was like a piece of enchantment. and who lived there? where was the  actual entrance? the whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops  and  there people could not always be running through.    one evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. the light burnt in the  room behind him  and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should  fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. yes! there it sat  directly  opposite  between the flowers on the balcony  and when the stranger  moved  the shadow also moved: for that it always does.    “i think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there ” said  the learned man. “see  how nicely it sits between the flowers. the door  stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning  and go into the  room  look about  and then come and tell me what it had seen. come  now!  be useful  and do me a service ” said he  in jest. “have the kindness to  step in. now! art thou going?” and then he nodded to the shadow  and the  shadow nodded again. “well then  go! but don't stay away.”    the stranger rose  and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony  rose also  the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.  yes! if anyone had paid particular attention to it  they would have  seen  quite distinctly  that the shadow went in through the half-open  balcony-door of their opposite neighbor  just as the stranger went into  his own room  and let the long curtain fall down after him.    next morning  the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the  newspapers.    “what is that?” said he  as he came out into the sunshine. “i have no  shadow! so then  it has actually gone last night  and not come again. it  is really tiresome!”    this annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone  but because  he knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* it was known  to everybody at home  in the cold lands  and if the learned man now came  there and told his story  they would say that he was imitating it  and  that he had no need to do. he would  therefore  not talk about it at  all  and that was wisely thought.    *peter schlemihl  the shadowless man.      in the evening he went out again on the balcony. he had placed the light  directly behind him  for he knew that the shadow would always have its  master for a screen  but he could not entice it. he made himself little   he made himself great: but no shadow came again. he said  “hem! hem!”   but it was of no use.    it was vexatious  but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly  and  after the lapse of eight days he observed  to his great joy  that a new  shadow came in the sunshine. in the course of three weeks he had a very  fair shadow  which  when he set out for his home in the northern lands   grew more and more in the journey  so that at last it was so long and so  large  that it was more than sufficient.    the learned man then came home  and he wrote books about what was true  in the world  and about what was good and what was beautiful  and there  passed days and years--yes! many years passed away.    one evening  as he was sitting in his room  there was a gentle knocking  at the door.    “come in!” said he  but no one came in  so he opened the door  and there  stood before him such an extremely lean man  that he felt quite strange.  as to the rest  the man was very finely dressed--he must be a gentleman.    “whom have i the honor of speaking?” asked the learned man.    “yes! i thought as much ” said the fine man. “i thought you would not  know me. i have got so much body. i have even got flesh and clothes. you  certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. do you not know your  old shadow? you certainly thought i should never more return. things  have gone on well with me since i was last with you. i have  in all  respects  become very well off. shall i purchase my freedom from  service? if so  i can do it”  and then he rattled a whole bunch of  valuable seals that hung to his watch  and he stuck his hand in the  thick gold chain he wore around his neck--nay! how all his fingers  glittered with diamond rings  and then all were pure gems.    “nay  i cannot recover from my surprise!” said the learned man. “what is  the meaning of all this?”    “something common  is it not ” said the shadow. “but you yourself do not  belong to the common order  and i  as you know well  have from a child  followed in your footsteps. as soon as you found i was capable to go  out alone in the world  i went my own way. i am in the most brilliant  circumstances  but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once  more before you die  you will die  i suppose? i also wished to see this  land again--for you know we always love our native land. i know you have  got another shadow again  have i anything to pay to it or you? if so   you will oblige me by saying what it is.”    “nay  is it really thou?” said the learned man. “it is most remarkable:  i never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man.”    “tell me what i have to pay ” said the shadow  “for i don't like to be  in any sort of debt.”    “how canst thou talk so?” said the learned man. “what debt is there to  talk about? make thyself as free as anyone else. i am extremely glad to  hear of thy good fortune: sit down  old friend  and tell me a little  how it has gone with thee  and what thou hast seen at our opposite  neighbor's there--in the warm lands.”    “yes  i will tell you all about it ” said the shadow  and sat down: “but  then you must also promise me  that  wherever you may meet me  you will  never say to anyone here in the town that i have been your shadow. i  intend to get betrothed  for i can provide for more than one family.”    “be quite at thy ease about that ” said the learned man  “i shall not  say to anyone who thou actually art: here is my hand--i promise it  and  a man's bond is his word.”    “a word is a shadow ” said the shadow  “and as such it must speak.”    it was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. it was dressed  entirely in black  and of the very finest cloth  it had patent leather  boots  and a hat that could be folded together  so that it was bare  crown and brim  not to speak of what we already know it had--seals  gold  neck-chain  and diamond rings  yes  the shadow was well-dressed  and it  was just that which made it quite a man.    “now i shall tell you my adventures ” said the shadow  and then he  sat  with the polished boots  as heavily as he could  on the arm of the  learned man's new shadow  which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet.  now this was perhaps from arrogance  and the shadow on the ground kept  itself so still and quiet  that it might hear all that passed: it wished  to know how it could get free  and work its way up  so as to become its  own master.    “do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?” said the  shadow. “it was the most charming of all beings  it was poesy! i was  there for three weeks  and that has as much effect as if one had lived  three thousand years  and read all that was composed and written   that is what i say  and it is right. i have seen everything and i know  everything!”    “poesy!” cried the learned man. “yes  yes  she often dwells a recluse  in large cities! poesy! yes  i have seen her--a single short moment   but sleep came into my eyes! she stood on the balcony and shone as the  aurora borealis shines. go on  go on--thou wert on the balcony  and went  through the doorway  and then--”    “then i was in the antechamber ” said the shadow. “you always sat and  looked over to the antechamber. there was no light  there was a sort  of twilight  but the one door stood open directly opposite the other  through a long row of rooms and saloons  and there it was lighted up. i  should have been completely killed if i had gone over to the maiden  but  i was circumspect  i took time to think  and that one must always do.”    “and what didst thou then see?” asked the learned man.    “i saw everything  and i shall tell all to you: but--it is no pride on  my part--as a free man  and with the knowledge i have  not to speak of  my position in life  my excellent circumstances--i certainly wish that  you would say you* to me!”    * it is the custom in denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the  second person singular  “du ” (thou) when speaking to each other. when  a friendship is formed between men  they generally affirm it  when  occasion offers  either in public or private  by drinking to each other  and exclaiming  “thy health ” at the same time striking their glasses  together. this is called drinking “duus”: they are then  “duus brodre ”   (thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun “thou ” to each  other  it being regarded as more familiar than “de ” (you). father and  mother  sister and brother say thou to one another--without regard to  age or rank. master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior  to the inferior. but servants and inferiors do not use the same term  to their masters  or superiors--nor is it ever used when speaking to a  stranger  or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquainted--they  then say as in english--you.      “i beg your pardon ” said the learned man  “it is an old habit with me.  you are perfectly right  and i shall remember it  but now you must tell  me all you saw!”    “everything!” said the shadow. “for i saw everything  and i know  everything!”    “how did it look in the furthest saloon?” asked the learned man. “was it  there as in the fresh woods? was it there as in a holy church? were the  saloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?”    “everything was there!” said the shadow. “i did not go quite in  i  remained in the foremost room  in the twilight  but i stood there  quite well  i saw everything  and i know everything! i have been in the  antechamber at the court of poesy.”    “but what did you see? did all the gods of the olden times pass through  the large saloons? did the old heroes combat there? did sweet children  play there  and relate their dreams?”    “i tell you i was there  and you can conceive that i saw everything  there was to be seen. had you come over there  you would not have been  a man  but i became so! and besides  i learned to know my inward nature   my innate qualities  the relationship i had with poesy. at the time i  was with you  i thought not of that  but always--you know it well--when  the sun rose  and when the sun went down  i became so strangely great   in the moonlight i was very near being more distinct than yourself  at  that time i did not understand my nature  it was revealed to me in the  antechamber! i became a man! i came out matured  but you were no longer  in the warm lands  as a man i was ashamed to go as i did. i was in  want of boots  of clothes  of the whole human varnish that makes a man  perceptible. i took my way--i tell it to you  but you will not put it in  any book--i took my way to the cake woman--i hid myself behind her   the woman didn't think how much she concealed. i went out first in the  evening  i ran about the streets in the moonlight  i made myself long up  the walls--it tickles the back so delightfully! i ran up  and ran down   peeped into the highest windows  into the saloons  and on the roofs  i  peeped in where no one could peep  and i saw what no one else saw  what  no one else should see! this is  in fact  a base world! i would not be a  man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so!  i saw the most unimaginable things with the women  with the men  with  parents  and with the sweet  matchless children  i saw ” said the  shadow  “what no human being must know  but what they would all  so willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. had i written a  newspaper  it would have been read! but i wrote direct to the persons  themselves  and there was consternation in all the towns where i came.  they were so afraid of me  and yet they were so excessively fond of  me. the professors made a professor of me  the tailors gave me new  clothes--i am well furnished  the master of the mint struck new coin for  me  and the women said i was so handsome! and so i became the man i am.  and i now bid you farewell. here is my card--i live on the sunny side  of the street  and am always at home in rainy weather!” and so away went  the shadow. “that was most extraordinary!” said the learned man. years  and days passed away  then the shadow came again. “how goes it?” said  the shadow.    “alas!” said the learned man. “i write about the true  and the good   and the beautiful  but no one cares to hear such things  i am quite  desperate  for i take it so much to heart!”    “but i don't!” said the shadow. “i become fat  and it is that one wants  to become! you do not understand the world. you will become ill by it.  you must travel! i shall make a tour this summer  will you go with me?  i should like to have a travelling companion! will you go with me  as  shadow? it will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me  i shall  pay the travelling expenses!”    “nay  this is too much!” said the learned man.    “it is just as one takes it!” said the shadow. “it will do you much good  to travel! will you be my shadow? you shall have everything free on the  journey!”    “nay  that is too bad!” said the learned man.    “but it is just so with the world!” said the shadow  “and so it will  be!” and away it went again.    the learned man was not at all in the most enviable state  grief and  torment followed him  and what he said about the true  and the good  and  the beautiful  was  to most persons  like roses for a cow! he was quite  ill at last.    “you really look like a shadow!” said his friends to him  and the  learned man trembled  for he thought of it.    “you must go to a watering-place!” said the shadow  who came and visited  him. “there is nothing else for it! i will take you with me for old  acquaintance' sake  i will pay the travelling expenses  and you write  the descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on the way!  i will go to a watering-place--my beard does not grow out as it  ought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! now you be  wise and accept the offer  we shall travel as comrades!”    and so they travelled  the shadow was master  and the master was the  shadow  they drove with each other  they rode and walked together  side  by side  before and behind  just as the sun was  the shadow always took  care to keep itself in the master's place. now the learned man didn't  think much about that  he was a very kind-hearted man  and particularly  mild and friendly  and so he said one day to the shadow: “as we have  now become companions  and in this way have grown up together from  childhood  shall we not drink 'thou' together  it is more familiar?”    “you are right ” said the shadow  who was now the proper master. “it is  said in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. you  as a learned  man  certainly know how strange nature is. some persons cannot bear to  touch grey paper  or they become ill  others shiver in every limb if one  rub a pane of glass with a nail: i have just such a feeling on hearing  you say thou to me  i feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first  situation with you. you see that it is a feeling  that it is not pride:  i cannot allow you to say thou to me  but i will willingly say thou to  you  so it is half done!”    so the shadow said thou to its former master.    “this is rather too bad ” thought he  “that i must say you and he say  thou ” but he was now obliged to put up with it.    so they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers  and  amongst them was a princess  who was troubled with seeing too well  and  that was so alarming!    she directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a  different sort of person to all the others  “he has come here in order  to get his beard to grow  they say  but i see the real cause  he cannot  cast a shadow.”    she had become inquisitive  and so she entered into conversation  directly with the strange gentleman  on their promenades. as the  daughter of a king  she needed not to stand upon trifles  so she said   “your complaint is  that you cannot cast a shadow?”    “your royal highness must be improving considerably ” said the shadow   “i know your complaint is  that you see too clearly  but it has  decreased  you are cured. i just happen to have a very unusual shadow!  do you not see that person who always goes with me? other persons have  a common shadow  but i do not like what is common to all. we give our  servants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use  and so i  had my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes  you see i have even given him  a shadow. it is somewhat expensive  but i like to have something for  myself!”    “what!” thought the princess. “should i really be cured! these baths are  the first in the world! in our time water has wonderful powers. but i  shall not leave the place  for it now begins to be amusing here. i am  extremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow   for in that case he will leave us!”    in the evening  the princess and the shadow danced together in the large  ball-room. she was light  but he was still lighter  she had never had  such a partner in the dance. she told him from what land she came  and  he knew that land  he had been there  but then she was not at home  he  had peeped in at the window  above and below--he had seen both the  one and the other  and so he could answer the princess  and make  insinuations  so that she was quite astonished  he must be the wisest  man in the whole world! she felt such respect for what he knew! so that  when they again danced together she fell in love with him  and that the  shadow could remark  for she almost pierced him through with her eyes.  so they danced once more together  and she was about to declare herself   but she was discreet  she thought of her country and kingdom  and of the  many persons she would have to reign over.    “he is a wise man ” said she to herself--“it is well  and he dances  delightfully--that is also good  but has he solid knowledge? that is  just as important! he must be examined.”    so she began  by degrees  to question him about the most difficult  things she could think of  and which she herself could not have  answered  so that the shadow made a strange face.    “you cannot answer these questions?” said the princess.    “they belong to my childhood's learning ” said the shadow. “i really  believe my shadow  by the door there  can answer them!”    “your shadow!” said the princess. “that would indeed be marvellous!”    “i will not say for a certainty that he can ” said the shadow  “but i  think so  he has now followed me for so many years  and listened to my  conversation--i should think it possible. but your royal highness will  permit me to observe  that he is so proud of passing himself off for  a man  that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to  answer well--he must be treated quite like a man.”    “oh! i like that!” said the princess.    so she went to the learned man by the door  and she spoke to him about  the sun and the moon  and about persons out of and in the world  and he  answered with wisdom and prudence.    “what a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!” thought she. “it  will be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if i choose him for my  consort--i will do it!”    they were soon agreed  both the princess and the shadow  but no one was  to know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.    “no one--not even my shadow!” said the shadow  and he had his own  thoughts about it!    now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at  home.    “listen  my good friend ” said the shadow to the learned man. “i have  now become as happy and mighty as anyone can be  i will  therefore  do  something particular for thee! thou shalt always live with me in the  palace  drive with me in my royal carriage  and have ten thousand  pounds a year  but then thou must submit to be called shadow by all and  everyone  thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man  and once  a year  when i sit on the balcony in the sunshine  thou must lie at my  feet  as a shadow shall do! i must tell thee: i am going to marry the  king's daughter  and the nuptials are to take place this evening!”    “nay  this is going too far!” said the learned man. “i will not have it   i will not do it! it is to deceive the whole country and the princess  too! i will tell everything! that i am a man  and that thou art a  shadow--thou art only dressed up!”    “there is no one who will believe it!” said the shadow. “be reasonable   or i will call the guard!”    “i will go directly to the princess!” said the learned man.    “but i will go first!” said the shadow. “and thou wilt go to prison!”   and that he was obliged to do--for the sentinels obeyed him whom they  knew the king's daughter was to marry.    “you tremble!” said the princess  as the shadow came into her chamber.  “has anything happened? you must not be unwell this evening  now that we  are to have our nuptials celebrated.”    “i have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to  see!” said the shadow. “only imagine--yes  it is true  such a poor  shadow-skull cannot bear much--only think  my shadow has become mad   he thinks that he is a man  and that i--now only think--that i am his  shadow!”    “it is terrible!” said the princess  “but he is confined  is he not?”    “that he is. i am afraid that he will never recover.”    “poor shadow!” said the princess. “he is very unfortunate  it would be  a real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has  and   when i think properly over the matter  i am of opinion that it will be  necessary to do away with him in all stillness!”    “it is certainly hard ” said the shadow  “for he was a faithful  servant!” and then he gave a sort of sigh.    “you are a noble character!” said the princess.    the whole city was illuminated in the evening  and the cannons went off  with a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. that was a marriage!  the princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves   and get another hurrah!    the learned man heard nothing of all this--for they had deprived him of  life.          the little match girl    most terribly cold it was  it snowed  and was nearly quite dark  and  evening--the last evening of the year. in this cold and darkness there  went along the street a poor little girl  bareheaded  and with naked  feet. when she left home she had slippers on  it is true  but what was  the good of that? they were very large slippers  which her mother had  hitherto worn  so large were they  and the poor little thing lost them  as she scuffled away across the street  because of two carriages that  rolled by dreadfully fast.    one slipper was nowhere to be found  the other had been laid hold of by  an urchin  and off he ran with it  he thought it would do capitally for  a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. so the  little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet  that were quite red  and blue from cold. she carried a quantity of matches in an old apron   and she held a bundle of them in her hand. nobody had bought anything of  her the whole livelong day  no one had given her a single farthing.    she crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of  sorrow  the poor little thing!    the flakes of snow covered her long fair hair  which fell in beautiful  curls around her neck  but of that  of course  she never once now  thought. from all the windows the candles were gleaming  and it smelt so  deliciously of roast goose  for you know it was new year's eve  yes  of  that she thought.    in a corner formed by two houses  of which one advanced more than the  other  she seated herself down and cowered together. her little feet  she had drawn close up to her  but she grew colder and colder  and to go  home she did not venture  for she had not sold any matches and could  not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get  blows  and at home it was cold too  for above her she had only the roof   through which the wind whistled  even though the largest cracks were  stopped up with straw and rags.    her little hands were almost numbed with cold. oh! a match might afford  her a world of comfort  if she only dared take a single one out of the  bundle  draw it against the wall  and warm her fingers by it. she drew  one out. “rischt!” how it blazed  how it burnt! it was a warm  bright  flame  like a candle  as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful  light. it seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting  before a large iron stove  with burnished brass feet and a brass  ornament at top. the fire burned with such blessed influence  it warmed  so delightfully. the little girl had already stretched out her feet to  warm them too  but--the small flame went out  the stove vanished: she  had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.    she rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly  and where the  light fell on the wall  there the wall became transparent like a  veil  so that she could see into the room. on the table was spread a  snow-white tablecloth  upon it was a splendid porcelain service  and the  roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried  plums. and what was still more capital to behold was  the goose hopped  down from the dish  reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its  breast  till it came up to the poor little girl  when--the match went  out and nothing but the thick  cold  damp wall was left behind.  she lighted another match. now there she was sitting under the most  magnificent christmas tree: it was still larger  and more decorated than  the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's  house.    thousands of lights were burning on the green branches  and  gaily-colored pictures  such as she had seen in the shop-windows  looked  down upon her. the little maiden stretched out her hands towards them  when--the match went out. the lights of the christmas tree rose higher  and higher  she saw them now as stars in heaven  one fell down and  formed a long trail of fire.    “someone is just dead!” said the little girl  for her old grandmother   the only person who had loved her  and who was now no more  had told  her  that when a star falls  a soul ascends to god.    she drew another match against the wall: it was again light  and in the  lustre there stood the old grandmother  so bright and radiant  so mild   and with such an expression of love.    “grandmother!” cried the little one. “oh  take me with you! you go  away when the match burns out  you vanish like the warm stove  like the  delicious roast goose  and like the magnificent christmas tree!” and  she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall  for  she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. and  the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at  noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and  so tall. she took the little maiden  on her arm  and both flew in  brightness and in joy so high  so very high  and then above was neither  cold  nor hunger  nor anxiety--they were with god.    but in the corner  at the cold hour of dawn  sat the poor girl  with  rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth  leaning against the wall--frozen  to death on the last evening of the old year. stiff and stark sat the  child there with her matches  of which one bundle had been burnt. “she  wanted to warm herself ” people said. no one had the slightest suspicion  of what beautiful things she had seen  no one even dreamed of the  splendor in which  with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a  new year.          the dream of little tuk    ah! yes  that was little tuk: in reality his name was not tuk  but that  was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for  charles  and it is all well enough if one does but know it. he had now  to take care of his little sister augusta  who was much younger than  himself  and he was  besides  to learn his lesson at the same time  but  these two things would not do together at all. there sat the poor little  fellow  with his sister on his lap  and he sang to her all the songs he  knew  and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book  that lay open before him. by the next morning he was to have learnt  all the towns in zealand by heart  and to know about them all that is  possible to be known.    his mother now came home  for she had been out  and took little augusta  on her arm. tuk ran quickly to the window  and read so eagerly that he  pretty nearly read his eyes out  for it got darker and darker  but his  mother had no money to buy a candle.    “there goes the old washerwoman over the way ” said his mother  as she  looked out of the window. “the poor woman can hardly drag herself along   and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. be a good boy   tukey  and run across and help the old woman  won't you?”    so tuk ran over quickly and helped her  but when he came back again into  the room it was quite dark  and as to a light  there was no thought of  such a thing. he was now to go to bed  that was an old turn-up bedstead   in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson  and of zealand  and  of all that his master had told him. he ought  to be sure  to have read  over his lesson again  but that  you know  he could not do. he therefore  put his geography-book under his pillow  because he had heard that was  a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson  but one  cannot  however  rely upon it entirely. well  there he lay  and thought  and thought  and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes  and mouth: he slept  and yet he did not sleep  it was as though the old  washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said  “it were a great  sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. you have aided  me  i therefore will now help you  and the loving god will do so at all  times.” and all of a sudden the book under tuk's pillow began scraping  and scratching.    “kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!”--that was an old hen who came creeping  along  and she was from kjoge. “i am a kjoger hen ” [*] said she  and then  she related how many inhabitants there were there  and about the battle  that had taken place  and which  after all  was hardly worth talking  about.         * kjoge  a town in the bay of kjoge. “to see the kjoge       hens ” is an expression similar to “showing a child london ”        which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands        and so lifting him off the ground. at the invasion of the       english in 1807  an encounter of a no very glorious nature       took place between the british troops and the undisciplined       danish militia.    “kribledy  krabledy--plump!” down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird   the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at prastoe. now he said that  there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body  and he  was very proud. “thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* plump! here  i lie capitally.”    * prastoe  a still smaller town than kjoge. some hundred paces from  it lies the manor-house ny soe  where thorwaldsen  the famed sculptor   generally sojourned during his stay in denmark  and where he called many  of his immortal works into existence.      but little tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on  horseback. on he went at full gallop  still galloping on and on. a  knight with a gleaming plume  and most magnificently dressed  held him  before him on the horse  and thus they rode through the wood to the old  town of bordingborg  and that was a large and very lively town. high  towers rose from the castle of the king  and the brightness of many  candles streamed from all the windows  within was dance and song   and king waldemar and the young  richly-attired maids of honor danced  together. the morn now came  and as soon as the sun appeared  the whole  town and the king's palace crumbled together  and one tower after the  other  and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle  had been before * and the town was so small and poor  and the school  boys came along with their books under their arms  and said  “2000  inhabitants!” but that was not true  for there were not so many.    *bordingborg  in the reign of king waldemar  a considerable place  now  an unimportant little town. one solitary tower only  and some remains of  a wall  show where the castle once stood.      and little tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed  and  yet as if he were not dreaming  however  somebody was close beside him.    “little tukey! little tukey!” cried someone near. it was a seaman   quite a little personage  so little as if he were a midshipman  but a  midshipman it was not.    “many remembrances from corsor.* that is a town that is just rising  into importance  a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches:  formerly people called it ugly  but that is no longer true. i lie on  the sea ” said corsor  “i have high roads and gardens  and i have given  birth to a poet who was witty and amusing  which all poets are not. i  once intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth  but  i did not do it  although i could have done so: and then  too  i smell  so deliciously  for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful  roses.”    *corsor  on the great belt  called  formerly  before the introduction  of steam-vessels  when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time  for a favorable wind  “the most tiresome of towns.” the poet baggesen  was born here.      little tuk looked  and all was red and green before his eyes  but as  soon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over  all of a sudden there  appeared a wooded slope close to the bay  and high up above stood a  magnificent old church  with two high pointed towers. from out the  hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water  so that there  was a continual splashing  and close beside them sat an old king with  a golden crown upon his white head: that was king hroar  near the  fountains  close to the town of roeskilde  as it is now called. and up  the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of denmark   hand in hand  all with their golden crowns  and the organ played and  the fountains rustled. little tuk saw all  heard all. “do not forget the  diet ” said king hroar.*    *roeskilde  once the capital of denmark. the town takes its name from  king hroar  and the many fountains in the neighborhood. in the beautiful  cathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of denmark are  interred. in roeskilde  too  the members of the danish diet assemble.      again all suddenly disappeared. yes  and whither? it seemed to him  just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. and now stood there an  old peasant-woman  who came from soroe * where grass grows in the  market-place. she had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and  back: it was so wet  it certainly must have been raining. “yes  that it  has ” said she  and she now related many pretty things out of holberg's  comedies  and about waldemar and absalon  but all at once she cowered  together  and her head began shaking backwards and forwards  and she  looked as she were going to make a spring. “croak! croak!” said she.  “it is wet  it is wet  there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in  sorbe!” she was now suddenly a frog  “croak”  and now she was an old  woman. “one must dress according to the weather ” said she. “it is wet   it is wet. my town is just like a bottle  and one gets in by the neck   and by the neck one must get out again! in former times i had the  finest fish  and now i have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the  bottle  who learn wisdom  hebrew  greek--croak!”    * sorbe  a very quiet little town  beautifully situated  surrounded by  woods and lakes. holberg  denmark's moliere  founded here an academy  for the sons of the nobles. the poets hauch and ingemann were appointed  professors here. the latter lives there still.      when she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs  or as if one  walked with great boots over a moor  always the same tone  so uniform  and so tiring that little tuk fell into a good sound sleep  which  by  the bye  could not do him any harm.    but even in this sleep there came a dream  or whatever else it was: his  little sister augusta  she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair   was suddenly a tall  beautiful girl  and without having wings was yet  able to fly  and she now flew over zealand--over the green woods and the  blue lakes.    “do you hear the cock crow  tukey? cock-a-doodle-doo! the cocks are  flying up from kjoge! you will have a farm-yard  so large  oh! so very  large! you will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! you will get on in the  world! you will be a rich and happy man! your house will exalt itself  like king waldemar's tower  and will be richly decorated with marble  statues  like that at prastoe. you understand what i mean. your name  shall circulate with renown all round the earth  like unto the ship that  was to have sailed from corsor  and in roeskilde--”    “do not forget the diet!” said king hroar.    “then you will speak well and wisely  little tukey  and when at last you  sink into your grave  you shall sleep as quietly--”    “as if i lay in soroe ” said tuk  awaking. it was bright day  and he was  now quite unable to call to mind his dream  that  however  was not at  all necessary  for one may not know what the future will bring.    and out of bed he jumped  and read in his book  and now all at once he  knew his whole lesson. and the old washerwoman popped her head in at the  door  nodded to him friendly  and said  “thanks  many thanks  my good  child  for your help! may the good ever-loving god fulfil your loveliest  dream!”    little tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed  but the loving god  knew it.          the naughty boy    along time ago  there lived an old poet  a thoroughly kind old poet. as  he was sitting one evening in his room  a dreadful storm arose without   and the rain streamed down from heaven  but the old poet sat warm  and comfortable in his chimney-corner  where the fire blazed and the  roasting apple hissed.    “those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin ”   said the good old poet.    “oh let me in! let me in! i am cold  and i'm so wet!” exclaimed suddenly  a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance  while  the rain poured down  and the wind made all the windows rattle.    “poor thing!” said the old poet  as he went to open the door. there  stood a little boy  quite naked  and the water ran down from his long  golden hair  he trembled with cold  and had he not come into a warm room  he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.    “poor child!” said the old poet  as he took the boy by the hand. “come  in  come in  and i will soon restore thee! thou shalt have wine and  roasted apples  for thou art verily a charming child!” and the boy was  so really. his eyes were like two bright stars  and although the water  trickled down his hair  it waved in beautiful curls. he looked exactly  like a little angel  but he was so pale  and his whole body trembled  with cold. he had a nice little bow in his hand  but it was quite  spoiled by the rain  and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one  into the other.    the old poet seated himself beside his hearth  and took the little  fellow on his lap  he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair   warmed his hands between his own  and boiled for him some sweet wine.  then the boy recovered  his cheeks again grew rosy  he jumped down from  the lap where he was sitting  and danced round the kind old poet.    “you are a merry fellow ” said the old man. “what's your name?”    “my name is cupid ” answered the boy. “don't you know me? there lies my  bow  it shoots well  i can assure you! look  the weather is now clearing  up  and the moon is shining clear again through the window.”    “why  your bow is quite spoiled ” said the old poet.    “that were sad indeed ” said the boy  and he took the bow in his hand  and examined it on every side. “oh  it is dry again  and is not hurt at  all  the string is quite tight. i will try it directly.” and he bent his  bow  took aim  and shot an arrow at the old poet  right into his heart.  “you see now that my bow was not spoiled ” said he laughing  and away he  ran.    the naughty boy  to shoot the old poet in that way  he who had taken him  into his warm room  who had treated him so kindly  and who had given him  warm wine and the very best apples!    the poor poet lay on the earth and wept  for the arrow had really flown  into his heart.    “fie!” said he. “how naughty a boy cupid is! i will tell all children  about him  that they may take care and not play with him  for he will  only cause them sorrow and many a heartache.”    and all good children to whom he related this story  took great heed  of this naughty cupid  but he made fools of them still  for he is  astonishingly cunning. when the university students come from the  lectures  he runs beside them in a black coat  and with a book under his  arm. it is quite impossible for them to know him  and they walk along  with him arm in arm  as if he  too  were a student like themselves  and  then  unperceived  he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. when the young  maidens come from being examined by the clergyman  or go to church to  be confirmed  there he is again close behind them. yes  he is forever  following people. at the play  he sits in the great chandelier and burns  in bright flames  so that people think it is really a flame  but they  soon discover it is something else. he roves about in the garden of the  palace and upon the ramparts: yes  once he even shot your father and  mother right in the heart. ask them only and you will hear what they'll  tell you. oh  he is a naughty boy  that cupid  you must never have  anything to do with him. he is forever running after everybody. only  think  he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! but that is a  long time ago  and it is all past now  however  a thing of that sort she  never forgets. fie  naughty cupid! but now you know him  and you know   too  how ill-behaved he is!          the red shoes    there was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate  but in  summer she was forced to run about with bare feet  she was so poor  and  in winter wear very large wooden shoes  which made her little insteps  quite red  and that looked so dangerous!    in the middle of the village lived old dame shoemaker  she sat and sewed  together  as well as she could  a little pair of shoes out of old red  strips of cloth  they were very clumsy  but it was a kind thought. they  were meant for the little girl. the little girl was called karen.    on the very day her mother was buried  karen received the red shoes   and wore them for the first time. they were certainly not intended for  mourning  but she had no others  and with stockingless feet she followed  the poor straw coffin in them.    suddenly a large old carriage drove up  and a large old lady sat in it:  she looked at the little girl  felt compassion for her  and then said to  the clergyman:    “here  give me the little girl. i will adopt her!”    and karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes  but  the old lady thought they were horrible  and they were burnt. but karen  herself was cleanly and nicely dressed  she must learn to read and sew   and people said she was a nice little thing  but the looking-glass said:  “thou art more than nice  thou art beautiful!”    now the queen once travelled through the land  and she had her little  daughter with her. and this little daughter was a princess  and people  streamed to the castle  and karen was there also  and the little  princess stood in her fine white dress  in a window  and let herself be  stared at  she had neither a train nor a golden crown  but splendid  red morocco shoes. they were certainly far handsomer than those dame  shoemaker had made for little karen. nothing in the world can be  compared with red shoes.    now karen was old enough to be confirmed  she had new clothes and was to  have new shoes also. the rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of  her little foot. this took place at his house  in his room  where stood  large glass-cases  filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. all  this looked charming  but the old lady could not see well  and so had  no pleasure in them. in the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones   just like those the princess had worn. how beautiful they were! the  shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count  but had  not fitted.    “that must be patent leather!” said the old lady. “they shine so!”    “yes  they shine!” said karen  and they fitted  and were bought  but the  old lady knew nothing about their being red  else she would never have  allowed karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. yet such was  the case.    everybody looked at her feet  and when she stepped through the chancel  door on the church pavement  it seemed to her as if the old figures on  the tombs  those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives  with  stiff ruffs  and long black dresses  fixed their eyes on her red shoes.  and she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her  head  and spoke of the holy baptism  of the covenant with god  and how  she should be now a matured christian  and the organ pealed so solemnly   the sweet children's voices sang  and the old music-directors sang  but  karen only thought of her red shoes.    in the afternoon  the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had  been red  and she said that it was very wrong of karen  that it was not  at all becoming  and that in future karen should only go in black shoes  to church  even when she should be older.    the next sunday there was the sacrament  and karen looked at the black  shoes  looked at the red ones--looked at them again  and put on the red  shoes.    the sun shone gloriously  karen and the old lady walked along the path  through the corn  it was rather dusty there.    at the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch  and with a  wonderfully long beard  which was more red than white  and he bowed to  the ground  and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. and  karen stretched out her little foot.    “see  what beautiful dancing shoes!” said the soldier. “sit firm when  you dance”  and he put his hand out towards the soles.    and the old lady gave the old soldier alms  and went into the church  with karen.    and all the people in the church looked at karen's red shoes  and all  the pictures  and as karen knelt before the altar  and raised the cup to  her lips  she only thought of the red shoes  and they seemed to swim  in it  and she forgot to sing her psalm  and she forgot to pray  “our  father in heaven!”    now all the people went out of church  and the old lady got into her  carriage. karen raised her foot to get in after her  when the old  soldier said     “look  what beautiful dancing shoes!”    and karen could not help dancing a step or two  and when she began her  feet continued to dance  it was just as though the shoes had power over  them. she danced round the church corner  she could not leave off  the  coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her  and he lifted  her in the carriage  but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on  the old lady dreadfully. at length she took the shoes off  and then her  legs had peace.    the shoes were placed in a closet at home  but karen could not avoid  looking at them.    now the old lady was sick  and it was said she could not recover. she  must be nursed and waited upon  and there was no one whose duty it was  so much as karen's. but there was a great ball in the city  to which  karen was invited. she looked at the old lady  who could not recover   she looked at the red shoes  and she thought there could be no sin in  it  she put on the red shoes  she might do that also  she thought. but  then she went to the ball and began to dance.    when she wanted to dance to the right  the shoes would dance to the  left  and when she wanted to dance up the room  the shoes danced back  again  down the steps  into the street  and out of the city gate. she  danced  and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.    then it was suddenly light up among the trees  and she fancied it must  be the moon  for there was a face  but it was the old soldier with  the red beard  he sat there  nodded his head  and said  “look  what  beautiful dancing shoes!”    then she was terrified  and wanted to fling off the red shoes  but they  clung fast  and she pulled down her stockings  but the shoes seemed to  have grown to her feet. and she danced  and must dance  over fields and  meadows  in rain and sunshine  by night and day  but at night it was the  most fearful.    she danced over the churchyard  but the dead did not dance--they had  something better to do than to dance. she wished to seat herself on a  poor man's grave  where the bitter tansy grew  but for her there was  neither peace nor rest  and when she danced towards the open church  door  she saw an angel standing there. he wore long  white garments  he  had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth  his countenance  was severe and grave  and in his hand he held a sword  broad and  glittering.    “dance shalt thou!” said he. “dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale  and cold! till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! dance shalt  thou from door to door  and where proud  vain children dwell  thou shalt  knock  that they may hear thee and tremble! dance shalt thou--!”    “mercy!” cried karen. but she did not hear the angel's reply  for the  shoes carried her through the gate into the fields  across roads and  bridges  and she must keep ever dancing.    one morning she danced past a door which she well knew. within sounded  a psalm  a coffin  decked with flowers  was borne forth. then she knew  that the old lady was dead  and felt that she was abandoned by all  and  condemned by the angel of god.    she danced  and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. the  shoes carried her over stack and stone  she was torn till she bled  she  danced over the heath till she came to a little house. here  she knew   dwelt the executioner  and she tapped with her fingers at the window   and said  “come out! come out! i cannot come in  for i am forced to  dance!”    and the executioner said  “thou dost not know who i am  i fancy? i  strike bad people's heads off  and i hear that my axe rings!”    “don't strike my head off!” said karen. “then i can't repent of my sins!  but strike off my feet in the red shoes!”    and then she confessed her entire sin  and the executioner struck off  her feet with the red shoes  but the shoes danced away with the little  feet across the field into the deep wood.    and he carved out little wooden feet for her  and crutches  taught  her the psalm criminals always sing  and she kissed the hand which had  wielded the axe  and went over the heath.    “now i have suffered enough for the red shoes!” said she. “now i will  go into the church that people may see me!” and she hastened towards the  church door: but when she was near it  the red shoes danced before her   and she was terrified  and turned round. the whole week she was unhappy   and wept many bitter tears  but when sunday returned  she said  “well   now i have suffered and struggled enough! i really believe i am as good  as many a one who sits in the church  and holds her head so high!”    and away she went boldly  but she had not got farther than the  churchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her  and she  was frightened  and turned back  and repented of her sin from her heart.    and she went to the parsonage  and begged that they would take her  into service  she would be very industrious  she said  and would do  everything she could  she did not care about the wages  only she wished  to have a home  and be with good people. and the clergyman's wife was  sorry for her and took her into service  and she was industrious and  thoughtful. she sat still and listened when the clergyman read the bible  in the evenings. all the children thought a great deal of her  but when  they spoke of dress  and grandeur  and beauty  she shook her head.    the following sunday  when the family was going to church  they asked  her whether she would not go with them  but she glanced sorrowfully   with tears in her eyes  at her crutches. the family went to hear the  word of god  but she went alone into her little chamber  there was only  room for a bed and chair to stand in it  and here she sat down with her  prayer-book  and whilst she read with a pious mind  the wind bore  the strains of the organ towards her  and she raised her tearful  countenance  and said  “o god  help me!”    and the sun shone so clearly  and straight before her stood the angel  of god in white garments  the same she had seen that night at the church  door  but he no longer carried the sharp sword  but in its stead a  splendid green spray  full of roses. and he touched the ceiling with the  spray  and the ceiling rose so high  and where he had touched it there  gleamed a golden star. and he touched the walls  and they widened out   and she saw the organ which was playing  she saw the old pictures of the  preachers and the preachers' wives. the congregation sat in cushioned  seats  and sang out of their prayer-books. for the church itself had  come to the poor girl in her narrow chamber  or else she had come into  the church. she sat in the pew with the clergyman's family  and when  they had ended the psalm and looked up  they nodded and said  “it is  right that thou art come!”    “it was through mercy!” she said.    and the organ pealed  and the children's voices in the choir sounded so  sweet and soft! the clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window  into the pew where karen sat! her heart was so full of sunshine  peace   and joy  that it broke. her soul flew on the sunshine to god  and there  no one asked after the red shoes.            end of project gutenberg's andersen's fairy tales  by hans christian andersen                            \""
